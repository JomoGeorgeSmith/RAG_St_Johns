StormFest - Family Weekend
Family Webinar Series
Welcome!
Parent and Family Connections is your partner for student success. We aim to provide you—our parents, families, and supporters—with various opportunities to learn more about St. John’s University and to explore how—together—we can support your student’s success.
We consider you to be members of our University community and a partner in your student’s college experience. You know your student best; Parent and Family Connections is a resource for when you feel your student needs extra support or for when you have a question or concern.
Your student’s journey at St. John’s depends on the support and encouragement of all of us—parents and families, as well as the faculty, administrators, and staff who offer St. John’s programs and services. Sometimes it requires our collective willingness, in just the right moment, to simply let go and watch them take their next steps.
To receive the latest St. John's news and updates designed specifically for parents and families, register for the
St. John's Parent and Family
portal.
Our relationship is a partnership. Together, we look forward to connecting with you to support your student’s success story at St. John’s!
StormFest
St. John's University is excited to host
StormFest
: Celebrating our Johnnies from the Past, Present, and Future on October 25–27. This weekend of campus fun is a wonderful combination of Family Weekend, Homecoming, and Open House all rolled into a fabulous extravaganza!

There's nothing like being on campus in dyanmic New York City! Tucked away on 102 landscaped acres, St. John's is an oasis located in Queens, nicknamed the World's borough as a reflection of its status as the most diverse county in the United States. Come visit and test the "Pizza Principle" --  does the cost of a subway ride really equal the cost of a slice of pizza!

Concerned About My Student
The Parent and Family Connections is your direct contact any time you have a concern about your student. For nonemergency concerns, please call 718-990-5783. For all emergencies at any time, please call Public Safety at 718-990-5252.
The administrators and staff in many of the University’s departments are prohibited from speaking with family members due to
privacy concerns
, so they may redirect families back to their student. Parent and Family Connections is aware there may be times when a family member just needs to discuss a concern about their child to gain a better understanding of the situation and the resources that may be available. We are here to listen and support. The relationship between the Parent and Family Connections and families is a partnership designed to support your student’s success story at St. John’s.
Family members are always encouraged to refer students to contact their Advisor who serves as their liaison for campus resources.

Science & Mathematics
Science and Mathematics represent half of the disciplines in STEM (i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and STEM-related fields are among the fastest-growing in the United States—and the world. As a result, those who pursue degrees in science and math work in an incredibly vast range of fields.
Why St. John's
At St. John’s, you gain a solid foundation in the knowledge and skills that underlie these areas as you learn from internationally known faculty and outstanding academic resources. The University’s close proximity to New York City equates to incredible access to some of the world’s leading businesses and organizations for internships, networking with alumni, and career opportunities.

Social Sciences
The Social Sciences include a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, economics, geography, history, international relations, political science, psychology, and sociology, and therefore the career path you can take with a degree in these areas is almost limitless. Like the humanities, social sciences allows you to explore various areas of interest, while strengthening your research, writing, and critical thinking skills.
Why St. John's
Whether you pursue one of these social sciences at St. John’s—or a combination of several—you develop a keen understanding of the world around you. Fittingly, you become a well-rounded global citizen, and when you graduate, you are equipped with the necessary resources to be personally and professionally successful in any field.

Sport, Hospitality & Fashion
At first glance, the worlds of sports, fashion, and hospitality may seem unrelated, but a closer examination finds that each area offers countless career opportunities—not just on the field of play, the runway, or in the penthouse suite—but behind the scenes, as well.
Why St. John's
St. John’s is in New York City, home to 10 major league sports franchises, as well as the headquarters of Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, and the United States Tennis Association. Our Sport Management majors learn from dedicated and experienced faculty and immerse themselves in the business of sports through internships, guest speakers, and alumni in the field.
For St. John’s students interested in making connections in the world of fashion, there are few cities that compare to New York, which, along with London, England; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France, make up fashion’s “Big 4.” Our faculty work closely with students to ensure that they enter this trillion-dollar industry with the skills and business sense they need to make an impact.
New York City is also a global destination for tourists, business leaders, government officials, and others—making it a remarkable place to learn about the worlds of hospitality, food and beverage, tourism, and event management.

The Arts
While some simply associate the arts with the stage and screen or galleries and museums, the truth is the arts are also widely considered a catalyst for the kind of innovative thinking needed to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems in myriad fields.
Why St. John's
There is no shortage of opportunities to showcase one’s talent and creativity at St. John’s University, from The Little Theatre, home of The Chappell Players theatre organization, to the Dr. M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Art Gallery, where students curate exhibitions. Furthermore, the University’s proximity to New York City translates to extraordinary access to Broadway, world-renowned museums, and countless opportunities to learn about the world—and your place in it.

St. John’s University Libraries’ Community Norms
St. John’s University Libraries fosters the open exchange of ideas and inquiry in a respectful environment free of harassment. Harassment may include comments, gestures, facial expressions, or imagery that demeans people based on language, religion, ethnicity, gender, physical or mental disability, physical appearance, or sexual preference. Those using library spaces, services and resources will treat other library users and employees with consideration and respect. We will respect the rights of others, and practice self-discipline. We will help protect the library collections and spaces while holding ourselves and each other accountable for keeping these norms. Together we can create a library environment that is welcoming, caring and affirming.
Adopted by the St. John’s University Libraries Faculty Council on November 2, 2021.

Research with Purpose
Helping the Knowledge Creators
Research is the heart of a university education. Professors create knowledge that benefits society, while students learn from their instructors’ expertise. The Office of Grants and Sponsored Research helps researchers at St. John’s to identify and secure funding.
Grants and Sponsored Research
Expanding the Boundaries of Scholarship
Professors at St. John’s are teacher-practitioners, using the experience they gain in the lab and in the field to enhance their students’ education. Yet their work influences the world beyond the campus, pushing the limits of medicine, technology, business, the arts, literature—virtually every endeavor that touches our lives.
Faculty Research
Distinguish Yourself
Since 2012, 24 St. John’s students have accepted prestigious Fulbright Scholar awards to conduct research and teach in countries around the world. You can join the talented young men and women who have received this honor.
Fulbright Scholarships
Showcasing Excellence
Every year, St. John's showcases the academic and scholarly achievements of students and faculty with a celebration featuring lectures, poster sessions, presentations, roundtables, and workshops.
Research Month
Creating Knowledge
As a University that inspires excellence, St. John’s develops, supports, and implements policies that encourage the creation of knowledge and intellectual property for the benefit of humanity.
Intellectual Property
Making an Impact
Diverse, driven, and dynamic—St. John’s undergraduate and graduate students join faculty in research projects in all fields. At St. John's, we focus on obtaining grant dollars, publishing scholarly work in peer-reviewed journals, and supporting students as they present at major conferences.

Student’s Research Shines Light on Women’s Role in East African Seaweed Trade
While some students preferred a summer break closer to home, St. John’s University graduate student Diana Nikoloski ’22CCPS traveled thousands of miles on a research journey that transformed her life.

In 2021 Diana journeyed to the East African archipelago of Zanzibar to study the harvesting of seaweed, one of the primary cash crops in the region. She built from that trip a research project, “The Role of Women in Seaweed Aquaculture in East Africa,” that won first prize in the University’s 2022 Student Research Conference.
Helping Others Serves as Impetus for Law Enforcement Career

Final Exam Schedule
Through its varied activities, the office works closely with the offices of the Provost, Information Technology, Admissions, Student Financial Services, the College Deans and the Student Success Center.
Services
The Office is responsible for the accuracy and integrity of the University's official student records. Our chief responsibilities fall into six broad categories: registration; record-keeping; enrollment verifications and transcripts; course offerings; classrooms scheduling; and graduation. The Office of the Registrar provides the following services:
Facilitates the University course registration processes;
Maintains student academic records and mails student report cards each semester;
Guarantees the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of student records in adherence to state and federal regulations;
Produces transcripts and enrollment verifications for students and alumni; and
Reports student enrollment information to the National Student Clearinghouse for loan providers, employers, background screening firms, and health insurance providers.

Request a Transcript
Click to Open
There are three ways you can order a transcript of your academic record at St. John’s University.
Electronic Transcripts (PDF)
Electronic Transcripts (PDF) are now available. Delivery is within hours of the request being processed. Electronic Transcripts are $6.50 per copy, payable by credit card only. St. John’s University has partnered with Parchment for electronic transcript delivery. Click
here
to order an eTranscript.
PDF transcripts are not available for students or alumni who attended prior to 1990 (please see below).
If you need a form or document included with your transcript, please use the electronic transcript request method of delivery.  You will be able to upload your fully completed documents to be sent along with your transcript.
Requestors will receive an email confirmation when the transcript is available for the recipient to download and another email when the transcript has been downloaded by the recipient.
PDF document delivery is becoming increasingly common across institutions, organizations, and agencies. However, before requesting PDF transcript delivery, please verify that the recipient will accept an electronic transcript. Additionally, it is important that you verify the correct email address for transmission of the transcript.
Official PDF transcripts are transmitted electronically to the recipient and is intended solely for use by the recipient. The official transcript has been digitally signed and therefore contains special characteristics.
The Blue Ribbon Symbol is assurance that the digital certificate is valid, the document is authentic, and the contents of the transcript have not been altered.
If the transcript does not display a valid certification and signature message an invalid digital certificate display means either the digital signature is not authentic, or the document has been altered. The digital signature can also be revoked by the transcript office if there is cause, and digital signatures can expire. A document with an invalid digital signature display should be rejected.
Author Unknown, can have two possible meanings: The certificate is a self-signed certificate or has been issued by an unknown or untrusted certificate authority and therefore has not been trusted, or the revocation check could not complete. If this message is received make sure there is a proper connection to the internet. If there is a connection and the digital signature cannot be validated, reject the document.
Any questions with electronic transcripts please call: 847-716-3005.
Via the Web
Current students may order transcripts via the web by signing into
signon.stjohns.edu
and clicking on the UIS icon. Under the Student menu click the Student Records link. From the Student Records menu, select Request Printed/Official Transcript and follow the prompts.  Please take special care entering the name and address of the recipient of your transcript.  These will print on the transcript exactly as you enter them. These transcripts will be mailed to the recipient via US mail.
If you need a form or document included with your transcript, please use the electronic transcript request method of delivery.  You will be able to upload your fully completed documents to be sent along with your transcript.
Recent alumni who continue to have access to UIS may also order transcripts online.
Mail-In Requests
All students and alumni may also order transcripts by mail. Any student who attended St. John's in 1984 or prior should submit a written request to the appropriate campus.

New York State's "Enough is Enough" Legislation
Effective October 5, 2015, New York State Legislation Article 129-B requires that, based on selected student conduct findings, all colleges and universities add notations to student transcripts. Through St. John’s University’s student conduct process, students found responsible for crimes of violence, including but not limited to, sexual violence will have the following transcript notations added:
Suspension Notation: Suspended after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation.
Expulsion Notation: Expelled after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation.
Notation if student withdraws from St John’s University while the investigation of the complaint is pending: Withdrew with conduct charges pending.
Those seeking the removal of a transcript notation for a suspension must submit a written appeal to the Office of the Registrar.  All such appeals will be reviewed by the Transcript Appeals Committee comprised of the Dean of Students or designee, the University Registrar or designee, and other University administrators as deemed appropriate. Suspension notations will not be removed prior to one year after the conclusion of the suspension. Expulsion notations are permanent.
If a finding of responsibility is vacated, for any reason, any related transcript notations will be removed.
Transcript Notations:
Significantly, Article 129-B mandates that higher education institutions include notations on the transcripts of students found responsible through the institution’s conduct process for crimes of violence, including, but not limited to, sexual violence, as set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(1)(F)(i)(I)-(VIII) of the Clery Act. Such transcript notations must state “suspended after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation” or “expelled after a finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation,” as applicable. Should the student withdraw from the higher education institution while the investigation of the complaint is pending, his or her transcript must note “withdrew with conduct charges pending.” Higher education institutions must have in place written policies regarding such transcript notations, which, at a minimum,  provide an appeals process for students seeking removal of such notations in accordance with Article 129-B.

Enrollment and Degree Verification
Click to Open
At St. John's University, student enrollment statuses are routinely transmitted to the National Student Clearinghouse throughout each academic period. Subsequently, the National Student Clearinghouse disseminates this data to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). This information serves as the basis for determining eligibility for Title IV grants and loans, as well as establishing repayment schedules for loans. It is imperative for students to remain informed about their enrollment status for a given term and its implications for their eligibility. Data provided to the National Student Clearinghouse is accessible by guaranty agencies, lenders and institutions who are determined to be authorized users of the data system.
The initial submission of enrollment data for a specific term occurs upon the conclusion of the add/drop period. Subsequent reports are transmitted on a monthly basis throughout the term to accommodate students who may enroll late or withdraw from courses.
Be advised, international students are not included in the reports to the National Student Clearinghouse.
If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact the National Student Clearinghouse via phone (703-742-4200) or fax (703-742-4239).

Social Security Number
A Public Notice about Social Security Numbers
New York State Education Law prohibits the use of the Social Security number for identification purposes. Additionally, the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (
FERPA
) prohibits the release of the Social Security number without a student's prior written consent. Neither the State of New York nor the Federal government requires the release of Social Security numbers except in a few carefully defined situations, chiefly related to verification of entitlement to financial aid.
Because of the above and because the Social Security number is not a part of a student's educational history, the Office of the Registrar at St. John's University does not confirm or in any other way make reference to or reveal a student's Social Security number.
When we confirm or verify a student's enrollment or the award of a degree, we certify academic information that our records contain, information that originates with us and that we have authority over. If, for example, we confirm that St. John's University awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree to Jane Doe on May 15, 2002, we assert that our records indicate that a person with this name received the degree indicated on the noted date. We do not, nor should we, authenticate anyone's identity.

Student Advisement Reports
Click to Open
Student Advisement Reports - DegreeWorks
Student Advisement Reports powered by DegreeWorks is a web-based program that enables you to easily track your academic progress. The report generated by DegreeWorks is an unofficial guide and source of information on degree requirements and GPAs which is a valuable tool for students and their advisors to enhance the advisement process. Students will be able to see how specific program requirements have been met and what courses still need to be taken to fulfill their requirements. Additionally, information on advisement reports is "real-time" - accurate at the point in time the report is run.
Accessing Student Advisement Reports in DegreeWorks
Students may access their Student Advisement Report through
signon.stjohns.edu
.
Once logged in to signon.stjohns.edu students can click the "DegreeWorks" widget to access the Student Advisement Report. Students will be able to view previous reports, generate a new report, or complete a "What-If Analysis".
Note: Students who started before Summer/Fall 2016 and students enrolled in the Graduate School of Education may access their report by selecting "Advisement Report (CAPP)" under the Student Advisement menu located in UIS after logging into signon.stjohns.edu. Students should follow the prompts to enter the appropriate term and proceed to view previous reports, generate a new report, or complete a "What-If Analysis".
To access captions, please toggle the "CC" button on the right-hand side of the video player.
Accuracy of Student Advisement Reports
Although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of Student Advisement Reports, these reports remain unofficial guides to degree progress. Students and advisors remain responsible for ensuring that all degree requirements are satisfied.
No degree will be automatically awarded based on a Student Advisement Report. Determinations to award or withhold degrees will continue to be made in each of the University's colleges according to its established policies and procedures.
Students should inform their advisors or deans of concerns about the information on their advisement reports.
Reading Student Advisement Reports in DegreeWorks
Student Advisement Reports are divided into different areas. These may vary by program. Typical areas are the major area, the core area, and elective credits applicable to this degree.
About the GPA
For each area, the advisement report gives a GPA, which is calculated solely from the grades in that area. This GPA is accurate for the grades shown but is not an official GPA - it is for informational purposes only.
The "Insufficient" section at the bottom of the advisement report shows all courses that have not been used to satisfy a degree requirement. This includes failed courses and those courses from which a student has withdrawn. These grades may count in a student's official GPA, major GPA, or honors GPA.
Note: The overall and program GPA's shown at the top of the advisement report include all grades in all courses taken.
Checking Your Degree Requirements
If a student has two (2) degrees, a report will need to be executed for each program.
Degree requirements for any given program may remain the same or may change from year to year. Changes may be minor or significant. As changes are coded, the advisement report will automatically take any changes into account.
To see a complete list of currently available programs, select the "What-If Analysis" option.
What-If Analysis
If a student is contemplating switching from their current major to another one a “What-if Analysis” should be run and will displays academic requirements for that major. The “What-if Analysis” feature shows how many program requirements have already been satisfied if a change of major is of interest. A “What-if Analysis” may be run against any available program.

Course Program of Study (CPoS)
Click to Open
What is CPoS?
Course program of study (CPoS) is a process designed to ensure that students are enrolled in classes that apply to their degree program of study.
CPoS reviews a student’s course registration for each term and compares it to the requirements of their degree program. Courses are flagged as degree applicable or not degree applicable.
CPoS helps students remain on track to graduate timely while keeping them eligible for their federal and/or state aid programs.
Make Sure Your Courses Count!
Federal and New York state regulations require that coursework be degree applicable for aid consideration.
Before registering for courses each semester review your Degree Works audit report and review your semester course registration plan with your academic advisor.
Timely Degree completion minimizes overall degree costs and student debt.
Common Questions and Answers
How will a student know if their courses count in the degree program?
Students should check their Degree Works audit to review required courses and remaining courses needed to complete their degree.
What happens if a student enrolls in courses that are not required to complete their degree?
Students that choose to enroll in courses that are not required to complete their degree could see their financial aid prorated and/or cancelled.
Can students still take courses not required for their degree?
Yes, students may take a course that is not required. Just know that the course will not count toward the financial aid enrollment status and may affect aid eligibility. Students should be prepared to pay for courses without federal and or state aid.
Do students have to be enrolled full-time to receive financial aid?
Enrollment Impact of Federal Aid
In most cases, full-time enrollment is not required to receive federal aid.
• The Federal Pell grant, TEACH Grant, Federal Work-Study Program and SEOG Program, don’t require fulltime enrollment, but the student’s enrollment status does affect the amount a student receives.
o    Pell recipients must be fulltime to receive the maximum grant. Pell eligibility for less than half time depends on the students estimated family contribution (EFC).
• Half time is required for federal student loans consideration and for loan deferment.
Enrollment Impact on New York State Aid:
• New York TAP and state scholarship recipients must be enrolled in 12 credits that are applicable toward their degree requirements to be eligible for their awards.
• Students receiving APTS need to insure that all their credits are applicable toward degree requirements.
Enrollment Impact on Institutional Aid:
• Institutional aid offered based on a student’s fulltime progress towards degree completion. Students receiving institutional aid are encouraged to complete their degree programs in a timely fashion and are reminded that in addition to basic eligibility requirements most academic scholarships are limited to four continuous academic years of study.
How are Enrollment statuses defined?
Undergraduate: Fulltime = 12 credits or more, Three Quarter = 9-11, Halftime = 6-8, Less than half time = <6
Graduate: Fulltime = 9 credits or more, Halftime = 6-9, less than half time = <6
Law: Fulltime = 11 credits or more, Halftime = 6-9, less than halftime = <6
What if I plan to study abroad for a semester?
The courses taken abroad must be applicable towards degree requirements to count toward a student’s financial aid enrollment status for federal and state aid programs.
What if I have a minor?
If a student’s degree program requires electives these electives can be used to determine a student’s enrollment status for financial aid; however if the student declares a minor only the number of electives needed to fulfill the degree elective requirement are eligible for financial aid consideration regardless of the number of electives required to fulfill the minor.

Residence Life
Focus on faith and service.
A Catholic university, St. John’s was founded in 1870 by the Congregation of the Mission (also known as the Vincentians). Today the Vincentian spirit lives in our students, faculty, administrators, and staff who performed nearly 140 000 hours of service in one year alone.  Whether volunteering at service Plunges in the US and abroad, at local soup kitchens, or on Midnight Runs in the streets of Manhattan, our St. John’s family devotes intellectual and physical resources to seek out the causes of poverty and social injustice and find practical meaningful solutions.
Faith and Mission
Expect to win.
Whether you're a student-athlete, a weekend warrior, or simply a fan — there are plenty of ways to get in the game at St. John's. St. John's is home to 17 Division I teams, and our men's basketball team plays select home games at Madison Square Garden. We also offer club and intramural sports, from bowling to eSports.

The first-ever graduate of the Master of Arts degree
program in Public History, Flor D’Luna (Arellano)
Blum ’09C, ’10G, ’15G, is now a park ranger in
the National Park Service stationed at the Statue of
Liberty. She gained her current position by interning
with the park service while a graduate student at
St. John’s.
“Public History is such an up and coming field, and
where I work is a great example of that,” said Ms.
Blum. “You have to make history accessible. I know
a lot of people who think you can only teach with a
history degree, and I do teach, but my classroom is
an island.”
Anthony Tedaldi ’10C, ’14G
After earning a Master of Science degree in
Chemistry and receiving a prestigious Woodrow
Wilson Teaching Fellowship in 2014, Anthony
Tedaldi ’10C, ’14G went on to distinguish himself

The Tobin M.B.A. enables you to select onsite courses, online courses, or flex courses. Flex courses
are structured so that the first seven weeks of a semester are conducted face-to-face onsite,
followed by the remaining seven weeks that are offered synchronously online. These courses are
designed to target students who are already part of the workforce.
The Tobin online M.B.A. program offers the flexibility and convenience to earn your degree
without compromising quality and is ranked in the top 33 online programs in the United States
by U.S. News & World Report. Our online classes are taught by full-time St. John’s faculty and
are of the same high caliber as those taught on campus.
The Tobin M.B.A. offers a 45-credit option for students looking to pursue two distinct
concentrations. These applicants will enroll in three courses in each discipline.
Graduating Tobin M.B.A. students may include up to nine credits of advanced standing toward
a Tobin M.S. program. Thus, you would need 21 additional credits to complete the second degree.

M.B.A. PROGRAMS
Tobin M.B.A.
The 36-credit Tobin M.B.A. program uses case studies, real-world projects, and an experiential
capstone course to transcend the normal classroom experience, while giving you a global
perspective and connections with alumni and corporate executives. You can enroll full time or
continue your career while taking courses in the evening.
STEM M.B.A.
The 45-credit STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) M.B.A.
program is designed to meet the needs of students who are interested in pursuing analytical
and technical management roles across industries. The federal government created the
STEM-designated degree program to address the shortage of qualified workers in the STEM
fields, which are estimated to grow by more than one million jobs by 2028. The STEM M.B.A.
program will make it possible for international graduates to remain in the United States for
an additional 24 months (36 months in total) after graduation and receive training through
work experience.
Along with the required M.B.A. core and capstone courses, the STEM M.B.A. requires you
to complete two concentrations of nine credit hours each from the following disciplines:
Business Analytics, Finance, Financial Technology (FinTech), Information Systems, Risk
Management, and Sustainability.
M.B.A. in Accounting
The 57-credit M.B.A. in Accounting is designed to fulfill the business and accounting
education requirements for the Uniform CPA Examination. In addition to the licensure-
qualifying C.P.A. accounting concentration, the M.B.A. in Accounting enables you to select
a second concentration from a wide range of disciplines.
J.D./M.B.A. Programs
The J.D./M.B.A. in Business Administration allows you to complete nine credit hours of
business courses and include them as law school electives. Likewise, you can use your
business-related law school coursework to meet a required course in business law and two
business concentration courses for the interdisciplinary M.B.A. You must currently be enrolled
in St. John’s University School of Law to apply to this program.

A Student Guide to Transferring Colleges
October 3, 2023
Deciding which college to attend is one of the biggest decisions of a young person’s life. But, the reality is, we don’t always get it right on the first try. In 2021, more than 1.2 million college students made the decision to transfer. While this is a relatively common occurrence in the academic world, it can be daunting—but when you make the decision to transfer colleges, you could find a better academic fit and campus culture, improved financial aid opportunities, and more. First, you have to figure out where to start. That’s where we can help.

FAQs
Prospective Transfer Student
Am I considered a transfer student?
Anyone who has taken courses at an institution after completing High School is considered a
transfer student.
How do I apply as a transfer student?
You can apply via our St. John’s Application or via the Common Application. Please visit:
https://www.stjohns.edu/admission/apply
Do I need to submit transcripts from an institution if I do not want any credits to transfer over
to St. John’s?
Yes. A transfer applicant must submit transcripts from all institutions previously attended, even
if it was only for a course. If you withdrew from all courses and your transcript reflects W
grades you will be expected to submit this record as well. All courses are considered for a
decision, even if you do not wish or expect to receive credit for it. Not submitting all transcripts
may result in a delay of an admission decision.
I submitted all of my transcripts, why am I being asked to submit a statement of activity?
If an applicant experienced any gaps or breaks in education a counselor may request a
Statement of Activity. A statement would include a brief explanation of what the student may
have been doing during any break. Breaks can occur after HS completion, a stop out of school,
between colleges, etc.
I have a copy of my college transcript can I submit this as part of my application?
Yes. We will accept unofficial academic records in the admission process. Note, if you enroll,
you are required to submit all official documents from all schools attended.
What is the easiest way to submit my documents?
Submitting documents is easier than ever. If you have a copy of the record you are looking to
submit, simply upload the document through the application portal you created with your St.
John’s application. Official documents can be sent electronically to transfers@stjohns.edu
Can I apply when I have courses that are in progress?
Yes. If you are in your first year of college, we recommend submitting your High School
transcript for review along with your college transcript reflecting any courses in progress.
Would I be considered for transfer admission if I was denied as a first-time applicant?
Yes. Transfer applicants are evaluated primarily on their course work and grades in college. A
student who demonstrates an improvement academically since entering college/university may
be admitted to St. John’s, even if s/he was previously denied as a first-time applicant.
Can a transfer advisor evaluate my credits prior to admission?
Please set up an advisement meeting with a transfer advisor to determine which of your credits
may transfer toward a degree at St. John’s. Please note, credit evaluations are performed for
admitted students.
Can transfer students receive scholarships?
Yes. St. John’s University offers scholarship to new transfer students. Please follow the link to
review available scholarship opportunities for transfers:
https://www.stjohns.edu/admission/scholarships/transfer-student-scholarships.
Do I have to apply to be considered for a transfer scholarship?
When your transfer admission application is reviewed by a transfer counselor, the scholarship will
be determined and offered if eligible. We do not have separate applications for transfer
scholarships.
Can international transfer students receive scholarships?
Yes. International transfer students may qualify for transfer scholarships. Please follow the link
to review available scholarship opportunities for transfers
https://www.stjohns.edu/admission/scholarships/transfer-student-scholarships.
Am I required to submit letters of recommendation and a personal essay?
Letters of Recommendations and personal essays are optional for our transfers with the
exception of transfer, pharmacy, applicants.
As a transfer student, will I be required to live on campus?
No. This is optional. You can choose to live on or off campus. You can choose to commute to
campus.
Is there a deadline to submit my application?
We review students on a rolling admission basis. You can apply through December for spring
consideration and by August for Fall consideration. Note, transfer, pharmacy applicants have an
application deadline of December 15th for Spring consideration and April 15th for Fall
consideration.
I was a student at St. John’s, and I am looking to return to complete my degree. How should I
proceed?
If you attended another institution after your enrollment with St. John’s, you will reapply as a
transfer student. If you have not attended any other institution since St. John’s, you can apply
as a readmit.
Please visit https://www.stjohns.edu/admission/apply for links to the above-mentioned
applications.
Accepted Student Questions
I just paid my admission deposit. How do I register for my classes?
For your first semester, Transfer Admission & Advising will register you for your courses. When
your schedule is available, you will receive an email with instructions to view your schedule.
What courses are eligible for transfer credit?
Generally, students may transfer credits from any 3-5 credit courses taken in which they earned a
grade of "C" or better. Transfer credits are considered as they apply to the St. John’s program of
study. Internship credits from previous institutions are not eligible for transfer.
How many credits can I transfer?
A maximum of 60 credits may be transferred from a two-year institution toward a bachelor’s
degree program. A maximum of 90 credits may be transferred from a four-year institution to a
bachelor’s degree program.
Will the GPA at my previous institution(s) transfer toward my degree at St. John’s?
No. A student's GPA at St. John’s is determined only by the courses taken at St. John’s. If in the
past, you took courses with St. John’s, you would hold a St. John’s GPA.
Is housing available to transfer students?
Transfer students who submit their enrollment and housing deposits can be considered for
housing on or off campus. Please be aware of the deposit deadline of May 1st which may impact
placement.
Am I required to attend an Orientation Program?
All new incoming students are required to attend an Orientation session. Orientation is a crucial
part of the undergraduate enrollment process. It helps new students learn about services,
programs, and key people on campus to assist with your transition to the University.
As an admitted transfer student, will I be able to defer my acceptance in the case where I
cannot attend?
Deposited students can request a deferral of his or her acceptance. Students can reach out to the
Transfer Admission and Advising team to request and complete a deferral form. When you defer,
you cannot attend any other college or university during this time. Your admission decision can be
held for up to one year of your admitted term.
I am an admitted student. Can I request a change of major?
Admitted students can make a request to change major through the student admission portal. At
the bottom of your student portal, you will find a red bar: Update your Information. From here,
you can update your housing status and request a change of major.
I reviewed my financial aid package with St. John’s, and I only see my transfer scholarships.
Where are my grants and aid from the FAFSA?
Packages are made available for admitted, St. John’s students. Student financial aid does not
automatically transfer from your previous institution to St. John’s. When you transfer, you may
need to update your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to include St. John’s. In
addition, FAFSA is for each academic year, Fall and Spring. If you transfer for the Spring semester,
the FAFSA you completed for that academic year is still available for you to use. Simply add St.
John’s University School code (002823) to your FAFSA by visiting, FAFSA.ed.gov. The same applies
if you qualify for the New York State Resident Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). Add St. John’s
University school code (0751) with HESC.ny.gov. This process will allow our Office of Financial
Services to put together your financial aid package.
If you did not include your social security number in your St. John’s application, this could be
another reason why you would not see a package from St. John’s.
Please be sure to update your social security number by logging into your UIS account:
www.stjohns.edu/UIS and visit the personal tab – Update Biographical Information.
Is tuition different if I am residing outside of NY or the U.S.?
There is a block tuition rate for all students:
https://www.stjohns.edu/admission/tuition-and-financial-aid/tuition/undergraduate-queens-
manhattan-and-online-learning
I completed my last semester. Where should I send my updated, official college transcript?
Transcripts may be submitted to the following address:
St. John’s University
Office of Undergraduate Admission
Attn: Undergraduate Admission Processing
8000 Utopia Parkway
Queens, NY 11439
We can also accept electronic transcripts sent directly from the school: transfers@stjohns.edu
A final, official transcript should not reflect any courses in progress.

How To Contact Us
The Office of Student Financial Services is committed to providing students and their families with the information they need to navigate and understand the financial aid and payment process. We hope the information provided here will prove useful and convenient to access.
File for Financial Aid
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA® ) is now available for the 2024-2025 Academic Year. New Students for the 2024–25 Academic Year should file as soon as possible. Priority FAFSA Deadline for Continuing Students for the 2024-2025 Academic Year is March 15, 2024.
To apply for financial aid for the 2024–25 academic year, students are encouraged to complete the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) form as soon as possible. Go to
studentaid.gov
or call 1-800-4FEDAID for more information.
Remember the FAFSA needs to be filed annually and must be filed by the last day of student’s enrollment within the academic year.
The FAFSA® IS CHANGING!
2024-25 FAFSA® was released December 31, 2023 rather than the traditional timeframe of October 1st. The FAFSA Simplification Act prioritized simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) application process, resulting in changes to the 2024–25 FAFSA® form, process, and methodologies for determining eligibility for federal aid. St. John's University along with all higher education institutions expect to begin receiving 2024-25 completed student FAFSA® information by the second half of March.   Learn more at

Allergy-Safe College Dining: Life-Changing Tips from a Registered Dietitian
September 30, 2024
Navigating the dining halls on a college campus can be intimidating for new students, especially those with food allergies.

As the St. John’s campus dietitian, I work closely with food service staff and food-allergic individuals daily to ensure that allergen-friendly options are available and that proper food handling protocols are followed when preparing meals for students with food allergies.

New Graduate’s Passions: St. John’s, Performing Arts, and Service
Even before attending her first class, Sheila Kiernan ’22CCPS felt like she found a second home at St. John’s University. “One of the reasons why I loved St. John’s was because giving back to the community is so much a part of its mission. I liked the location—but I really liked the feel of the Queens, NY, campus and the University.”

Your Home on Campus
Whether you are a resident or commuter student, Catholic or another faith, make Campus Ministry your home at St. John's. We welcome all students to take part in programs and discussions that deepen their faith while contributing to life in our academic community and beyond.
Campus Ministry
Answering the Call
You have what it takes to be a leader. St. John’s helps you fulfill your potential by combining sound management sense with faith-based values through programs like VITAL (Vincentian Initiative to Advance Leadership) and the Ozanam Scholars Program. See where your talents will take you.

Taking on the Status Quo
If you do not like what you see, change it. That is the example St. Vincent de Paul set by fighting poverty and injustice—and that is what you can do through St. John’s many programs devoted to social action. In fact, some of the most meaningful lessons our students learn are through actively helping to create a better world—socially, politically, and economically.

Announcements and Updates
March 2023 Update from the Office of Equity and Inclusion
Click to Open
Over the past two years, St. John’s University has taken several steps to honor our
pledge to promote antiracism
and ensure that our community is a place of belonging and inclusion where all members feel welcome. As we continue to witness the senseless acts of injustice, racial hostility, and pain across our country, the sense of urgency and need to align all facets of St. John’s with our standing principles are ever the more urgent.
To that end, I am pleased to share that the
Board of Trustees
voted at its
meeting
on February 15—in recognition of the newly established
Office of Equity and Inclusion
—that a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee would be formed as part of its accountability structure. This group will be at the forefront of the Board’s ongoing efforts to promote antiracism and a diverse and inclusive University community.
We all know nothing much happens without leadership—and ensuring diverse, inclusive, and equitable practices is no different. In fact, leaders on these issues need to exemplify what is being asked of others: authenticity, courage, curiosity, humility, introspection, self-awareness, and vulnerability, to name a few characteristics.
Rev. Brian J. Shanley, O.P.
, President, and William J. Janetschek ’84CBA, ’17HON, Board Chair, will visibly support this work and serve as members of the committee.
Chaired by Board member Tarik S. Turner ’98C, the DEI Committee is charged to
support and monitor the University’s key strategic efforts related to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion goals;
advise the Board of Trustees about emerging issues and the activities and resources associated with meeting the University’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals;
oversee the development and implementation of educational programming related to racism—especially issues of structural or systemic racism in the United States—and its continuing effects within higher education and the University; and
monitor the demographics and working conditions of employees; the enrollment and educational climate of students; and, at least annually, review reports on the demographics of University students, faculty, administrators, and staff.
The current members of the DEI Committee are
Stephon Barnes, Chief Operating Officer,
CFI Partners, LLC

Celebrating Pride 2022
Click to Open
As many of you know, June is
LGBTQIA+ Pride Month
, commemorating the first Pride protest which was led outside the Stonewall Inn in New York in 1969.
There are a variety of ways to celebrate Pride this year, with many events resuming in person. For anyone looking to get involved in a meaningful way—from parades to 5ks to social action—the University’s
Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
has compiled a
Pride Month 2022 Resource Guide
as a helpful starting point.
In addition, a prerecorded webinar is available on the EAP member website,
www.myccaonline.com
(company code:
stjohns
). Titled “#PrideIncluded: LGBTQIA+ Inclusivity and Equity,” the session encourages participants to explore their roles in promoting inclusion and acceptance in the community and the workplace.
As we celebrate Pride, we also acknowledge the challenges that the LGBTQIA+ community continues to face today. We encourage the LGBTQIA+ members of our St. John’s community to
practice self-care
and surround yourselves with people who love you, believe in you, cheer for you, and listen to you. However you choose to honor Pride Month, we hope your celebrations are safe and meaningful.

Employee Resource Groups
Click to Open
In the Fall of 2020, the University announced the launch of formal Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) at St. John’s. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that help to foster an equitable and inclusive workplace, as well as cultivate a greater sense of belonging. ERGs are open to all St. John’s University faculty, administrators, and staff. An ERG may form around a shared identity, a shared interest or concern, or a professional/career affiliation.
Preference in the initial launch will be shown to ERGs that support minoritized social identities in our workplace.  An
ERG Proposal Form
and
Getting Started Guide
, along with a comprehensive
ERG Guidebook
and other program resources, are available on
St. John’s Connect
. To learn more, login to
St. John's Connect
and click on Campus Resources. From the Resources header, click the "Employee Information" icon and then "Employee ERGs."
Employees who are interested in starting a group are encouraged to review the ERG resources, and then identify two coleaders to complete the required proposal information online. Should you have questions, a Human Resources representative can be reached at ERG@stjohns.edu.

The Trevor Project 2021 report found that LGBTQ+ youth
who had access to supportive spaces that affirmed their
gender identity and sexual orientation had lower rates of
attempted suicide. Many young people also reported that
despite hardships, they also found strength and joy through
things such as representation in media, learning more about
LGBTQ history, and therapy.
If you are dealing with a mental health issue, it is important
to get help. Discrimination can not only lead to increased
risk for mental health issues like depression and anxiety,
but it can also affect the amount and quality of support that
people may have from their own families.
In cases where people experience rejection by their own
family, reaching out to friends and other sources of support
is essential. Talking to a mental health professional can be
helpful. You might start by discussing the issue with your
doctor, who may be able to recommend a supportive
professional in your community. You may also check with
some of the resources listed below to find therapists or
support groups in your community.

University Crest
The redesigned crest restores the original blue and red, liturgical colors evoking the “Blessed Virgin and the Humanity of Her Divine Son.” The white cross at its center further identifies Christ as the foundation and model for a moral, ethical character, as does the motto Ecce Agnus (“Behold the Lamb of God”), recalling St. John the Baptist’s testimony to the divinity of Christ. The fleur-de-lis symbolizes France, homeland of St. Vincent de Paul. The heart represents his commitment to charity. The escalloped shell—an ancient symbol of the sacrament of baptism—signifies St. James the Greater, titular of the cathedral of the Diocese of Brooklyn, where the University was founded. The shell also recalls a Native American name for Long Island: “Sewanhacky” (“Island of Shells”).
Especially prominent is the banner encircling the lower half of the crest. It bears the motto “Educatio Christiana Animae Perfectio” (“Christian education perfects the soul”), a testament to the ethos that guides St. John's University.

Green Initiatives & Eco-Friendly Practices
Sustainability is a long-term responsibility to meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. The environment has a limit and it must be respected and embraced. At St. John's, our Sustainability Coordinators work together to promote a more sustainable campus.
Climate Action Plan
St. John’s is on the path with a roadmap to achieve 50 percent carbon emissions reduction from energy consumed by buildings by year 2030. Within the new NYC Climate Mobilization Act of 2019 there are tiered emissions compliance targets for 2024 and 2030. Being below the emissions limits for 2024, St. John’s is developing plans to meet its 2030 emissions limit and includes renewable energy sources such as geothermal and solar power.
St. John’s Energy Master Plan 2017 can be viewed
here
.
Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, & Rating System™ (STARS)
STARS, developed by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, is a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance. STARS ratings last three years. As a
Charter Participant in STARS
, St. John's achieved a Silver rating in 2011 and upgraded to a Gold rating in 2012 and 2016.

Student Involvement
The Office of Sustainability partners with Residence Life to engage students in their dorms to live more sustainably through recycling enhancements and energy conservation. Events include an Energy Reduction Tournament “Conserve to Serve,” Move-out Food and Clothing Collection, Earth Week, Train the Trainer program with Resident Assistants, Campus Sustainability Day, Battle of Buildings for Spirit, RecycleMania, Campaigns for Awareness and Involvement, and Green-Handed Raffles.
Municipal Solid Waste & Recycling
St. John's participates in RecycleMania, a spring semester, eight-week, nationwide tournament involving more than 400 schools. The University reached a diversion rate of 50 percent for RecycleMania 2017 and achieved the RecycleMania’s national title in the Food Waste Reduction category for the
Campus Engagement Case Study Competition
.
At St. John's, recycling and food waste reduction efforts are ongoing, and include implementation of single stream recycling, enhancements to hardware (bins and signage), staff retraining, and food waste recovery. Help change a culture of waste by making recycling and waste reduction a top priority.
Student Sustainability Coordinators
Since 2008, St. John's has maintained a team of student workers as Sustainability Coordinators. These students perform a variety of tasks, from policing campus-wide recycling of municipal solid waste to running campaigns for student involvement in energy conservation. These workers perform daily collection of food waste to generate on-site composting, as well as maintain the organic garden and run numerous special events.
EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge (FRC) Program
St. John's is a charter participant in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s FRC program, which has three primary actions: food waste prevention; food recovery for donation; and food waste composting.
Food Waste Compost System
Annually, St. John's composts on-site over 100 tons of food waste (95% of all campus food waste). The Office of Sustainability with student workers built and operate an aerated static pile (ASP) three-bin composting system.  Source separation is done by Chartwells Dining Service, then, food waste (1,000 pounds per day) is processed through a pulper machine. Each week, the pulped food waste is mixed with wood chips and loaded into one of three ASP composting bins. After three weeks in the ASP followed by 12 weeks in winnow, the compost can then screened/finished and applied to the campus grounds.
Food Recovery
St. John's is a registered Chapter in
Food Recovery Network
and with the help of Chartwells Dining Service, annually recovers over 6,000 pounds of good prepared food for donation to help alleviate hunger.
Tree Campus USA Program
St. John's received
Tree Campus USA
participation awards for the past s seven years by meeting the program criteria of tree care committee; tree care plan; finding the tree care program; incorporation of Academic Service-Learning (ASL); and Annual Arbor Day observance / event. The Queens campus has over 3,000 trees, 500 of which came from the NYC Million Trees project (2008–11). With faculty over site, in 2013 students planted a northeast native species campus arboretum around the softball field. Each year, the University's Campus Tree Mapping Project grows with the help of students guided by dedicated faculty member Paula Lazrus. Currently there are more than 1,000 trees mapped. You can view the progress of the University's Tree Mapping Project at
https://sju.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=e93c6f15a2b24969bf5ab32fa20d2955
.
Student Community Garden
The student community garden is an organic vegetable garden built and maintained by student workers and the Student Earth Club. The garden consists of more than 50 semi-raised planting beds with organic soils, automatic irrigation, and central drainage system. Students harvest and deliver the vegetables to help support
St. John’s Bread & Life soup kitchen
in Brooklyn, NY. Over 1,000 pounds of vegetables are harvested annually.
On-Site Food Waste Compost System
St. John's began composting food waste in 2009. In 2011, through the Office of Sustainability, student workers built a large-scale aerated static pile (ASP) three-bin composting facility. Each day during academic semesters, student workers pick up about 1,000 pounds of preconsumer and postconsumer food waste from five campus kitchens and process it through a pulper machine. Each week, the pulped food waste is mixed with wood chips and loaded into one of three ASP (6-cubic yard) bins. After three weeks in the ASP followed by 10 weeks in winnow, the compost is then screened/finished and applied to the campus grounds. Annually, St. John's recovers about 42 tons of food waste and paper napkins for composting and mixes it with 12 tons of wood chips.
Compost Tea Brewing and Application
Compost made on-site is also used in compost tea brewing. After brewing the tea, organic solutions and minerals are added and the tea is applied /sprayed to the soils in campus tree and shrub beds. The University conducts compost tea brewing workshops in the spring and fall. These workshops presents a cocurricular opportunity for students and faculty to learn about composting, soil biology, and the soil food web.
Outreach & Marketing
The University engages and strives to partner with numerous organizations. Some of these are; NYC Carbon Challenge; NYS Association of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle; EPA; The Arbor Day Foundation; Association For the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE); Con Edison and; NYSDEC. On-campus, The Sustainability Office  most often communicates with Residence Life, Student Earth Club, Learning Communities, Academic Service Learning, Student Wellness, Campus Ministry, and Human Resources.
