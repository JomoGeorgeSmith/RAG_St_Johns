Building a Community of Faith, Service, and Friendship

Why stop at making your mark? At St. John’s, you help make the world a better place. We create opportunities for students to gain inspiration from their individual faith traditions by volunteering, fighting injustice, and serving those in need.

Service

Our Mission

St. Thomas More Church

Make a World of Difference

Gathering Together

The church is the center of the Queens campus and our mission.  What happens here nourishes what happens in all of the classrooms and labs, and on all of the campuses and playing fields, preparing our students to go forth in love and service.

St. Thomas More Church

Your Home on Campus

Whether you are a resident or commuter student, Catholic or another faith, make Campus Ministry your home at St. John's. We welcome all students to take part in programs and discussions that deepen their faith while contributing to life in our academic community and beyond.

Campus Ministry

Answering the Call

You have what it takes to be a leader. St. John’s helps you fulfill your potential by combining sound management sense with faith-based values through programs like VITAL (Vincentian Initiative to Advance Leadership) and the Ozanam Scholars Program. See where your talents will take you.

Leadership & Development

Taking on the Status Quo

If you do not like what you see, change it. That is the example St. Vincent de Paul set by fighting poverty and injustice—and that is what you can do through St. John’s many programs devoted to social action. In fact, some of the most meaningful lessons our students learn are through actively helping to create a better world—socially, politically, and economically.

Announcements and Updates

March 2023 Update from the Office of Equity and Inclusion

Click to Open

Over the past two years, St. John’s University has taken several steps to honor our pledge to promote antiracism and ensure that our community is a place of belonging and inclusion where all members feel welcome. As we continue to witness the senseless acts of injustice, racial hostility, and pain across our country, the sense of urgency and need to align all facets of St. John’s with our standing principles are ever the more urgent.

To that end, I am pleased to share that the Board of Trustees voted at its meeting on February 15—in recognition of the newly established Office of Equity and Inclusion—that a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee would be formed as part of its accountability structure. This group will be at the forefront of the Board’s ongoing efforts to promote antiracism and a diverse and inclusive University community.

We all know nothing much happens without leadership—and ensuring diverse, inclusive, and equitable practices is no different. In fact, leaders on these issues need to exemplify what is being asked of others: authenticity, courage, curiosity, humility, introspection, self-awareness, and vulnerability, to name a few characteristics. Rev. Brian J. Shanley, O.P., President, and William J. Janetschek ’84CBA, ’17HON, Board Chair, will visibly support this work and serve as members of the committee.

Chaired by Board member Tarik S. Turner ’98C, the DEI Committee is charged to

support and monitor the University’s key strategic efforts related to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion goals;

advise the Board of Trustees about emerging issues and the activities and resources associated with meeting the University’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals;

oversee the development and implementation of educational programming related to racism—especially issues of structural or systemic racism in the United States—and its continuing effects within higher education and the University; and

monitor the demographics and working conditions of employees; the enrollment and educational climate of students; and, at least annually, review reports on the demographics of University students, faculty, administrators, and staff.

The current members of the DEI Committee are

Stephon Barnes, Chief Operating Officer, CFI Partners, LLC

Robert J. Cruz ’96SVC, Senior Vice President, National Branch Officer, Director of Field Operations, Starr Companies

Celebrating Pride 2022

Click to Open

As many of you know, June is LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, commemorating the first Pride protest which was led outside the Stonewall Inn in New York in 1969.

There are a variety of ways to celebrate Pride this year, with many events resuming in person. For anyone looking to get involved in a meaningful way—from parades to 5ks to social action—the University’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) has compiled a Pride Month 2022 Resource Guide as a helpful starting point.

In addition, a prerecorded webinar is available on the EAP member website, www.myccaonline.com (company code: stjohns). Titled “#PrideIncluded: LGBTQIA+ Inclusivity and Equity,” the session encourages participants to explore their roles in promoting inclusion and acceptance in the community and the workplace.

As we celebrate Pride, we also acknowledge the challenges that the LGBTQIA+ community continues to face today. We encourage the LGBTQIA+ members of our St. John’s community to practice self-care and surround yourselves with people who love you, believe in you, cheer for you, and listen to you. However you choose to honor Pride Month, we hope your celebrations are safe and meaningful.

Employee Resource Groups

Click to Open

In the Fall of 2020, the University announced the launch of formal Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) at St. John’s. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that help to foster an equitable and inclusive workplace, as well as cultivate a greater sense of belonging. ERGs are open to all St. John’s University faculty, administrators, and staff. An ERG may form around a shared identity, a shared interest or concern, or a professional/career affiliation.

Preference in the initial launch will be shown to ERGs that support minoritized social identities in our workplace.  An ERG Proposal Form and Getting Started Guide, along with a comprehensive ERG Guidebook and other program resources, are available on St. John’s Connect. To learn more, login to St. John's Connect and click on Campus Resources. From the Resources header, click the "Employee Information" icon and then "Employee ERGs."

Employees who are interested in starting a group are encouraged to review the ERG resources, and then identify two coleaders to complete the required proposal information online. Should you have questions, a Human Resources representative can be reached at ERG@stjohns.edu.

University Crest

The redesigned crest restores the original blue and red, liturgical colors evoking the “Blessed Virgin and the Humanity of Her Divine Son.” The white cross at its center further identifies Christ as the foundation and model for a moral, ethical character, as does the motto Ecce Agnus (“Behold the Lamb of God”), recalling St. John the Baptist’s testimony to the divinity of Christ. The fleur-de-lis symbolizes France, homeland of St. Vincent de Paul. The heart represents his commitment to charity. The escalloped shell—an ancient symbol of the sacrament of baptism—signifies St. James the Greater, titular of the cathedral of the Diocese of Brooklyn, where the University was founded. The shell also recalls a Native American name for Long Island: “Sewanhacky” (“Island of Shells”).

Especially prominent is the banner encircling the lower half of the crest. It bears the motto “Educatio Christiana Animae Perfectio” (“Christian education perfects the soul”), a testament to the ethos that guides St. John's University.

Green Initiatives & Eco-Friendly Practices

Sustainability is a long-term responsibility to meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. The environment has a limit and it must be respected and embraced. At St. John's, our Sustainability Coordinators work together to promote a more sustainable campus.

Climate Action Plan

St. John’s is on the path with a roadmap to achieve 50 percent carbon emissions reduction from energy consumed by buildings by year 2030. Within the new NYC Climate Mobilization Act of 2019 there are tiered emissions compliance targets for 2024 and 2030. Being below the emissions limits for 2024, St. John’s is developing plans to meet its 2030 emissions limit and includes renewable energy sources such as geothermal and solar power.

St. John’s Energy Master Plan 2017 can be viewed here.

Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, & Rating System™ (STARS)

STARS, developed by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, is a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance. STARS ratings last three years. As a Charter Participant in STARS, St. John's achieved a Silver rating in 2011 and upgraded to a Gold rating in 2012 and 2016.

Categories of the STARS 2.0 Technical Manual

Academics Curriculum Research Operations Air and Climate Buildings Dining Services Energy Grounds Purchasing Transportation Waste Water Engagement Campus Engagement Public Engagement Planning and Administration Coordination, Planning, and Governance Diversity and Affordability Health, Wellbeing, and Work Investment Innovation

Student Involvement

The Office of Sustainability partners with Residence Life to engage students in their dorms to live more sustainably through recycling enhancements and energy conservation. Events include an Energy Reduction Tournament “Conserve to Serve,” Move-out Food and Clothing Collection, Earth Week, Train the Trainer program with Resident Assistants, Campus Sustainability Day, Battle of Buildings for Spirit, RecycleMania, Campaigns for Awareness and Involvement, and Green-Handed Raffles.

Municipal Solid Waste & Recycling

St. John's participates in RecycleMania, a spring semester, eight-week, nationwide tournament involving more than 400 schools. The University reached a diversion rate of 50 percent for RecycleMania 2017 and achieved the RecycleMania’s national title in the Food Waste Reduction category for the Campus Engagement Case Study Competition.

At St. John's, recycling and food waste reduction efforts are ongoing, and include implementation of single stream recycling, enhancements to hardware (bins and signage), staff retraining, and food waste recovery. Help change a culture of waste by making recycling and waste reduction a top priority.

Student Sustainability Coordinators

Since 2008, St. John's has maintained a team of student workers as Sustainability Coordinators. These students perform a variety of tasks, from policing campus-wide recycling of municipal solid waste to running campaigns for student involvement in energy conservation. These workers perform daily collection of food waste to generate on-site composting, as well as maintain the organic garden and run numerous special events.

EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge (FRC) Program

St. John's is a charter participant in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s FRC program, which has three primary actions: food waste prevention; food recovery for donation; and food waste composting.

Food Waste Compost System

Annually, St. John's composts on-site over 100 tons of food waste (95% of all campus food waste). The Office of Sustainability with student workers built and operate an aerated static pile (ASP) three-bin composting system.  Source separation is done by Chartwells Dining Service, then, food waste (1,000 pounds per day) is processed through a pulper machine. Each week, the pulped food waste is mixed with wood chips and loaded into one of three ASP composting bins. After three weeks in the ASP followed by 12 weeks in winnow, the compost can then screened/finished and applied to the campus grounds.

Food Recovery

St. John's is a registered Chapter in Food Recovery Network and with the help of Chartwells Dining Service, annually recovers over 6,000 pounds of good prepared food for donation to help alleviate hunger.

Tree Campus USA Program

St. John's received Tree Campus USA participation awards for the past s seven years by meeting the program criteria of tree care committee; tree care plan; finding the tree care program; incorporation of Academic Service-Learning (ASL); and Annual Arbor Day observance / event. The Queens campus has over 3,000 trees, 500 of which came from the NYC Million Trees project (2008–11). With faculty over site, in 2013 students planted a northeast native species campus arboretum around the softball field. Each year, the University's Campus Tree Mapping Project grows with the help of students guided by dedicated faculty member Paula Lazrus. Currently there are more than 1,000 trees mapped. You can view the progress of the University's Tree Mapping Project at https://sju.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=e93c6f15a2b24969bf5ab32fa20d2955.

Student Community Garden

The student community garden is an organic vegetable garden built and maintained by student workers and the Student Earth Club. The garden consists of more than 50 semi-raised planting beds with organic soils, automatic irrigation, and central drainage system. Students harvest and deliver the vegetables to help support St. John’s Bread & Life soup kitchen in Brooklyn, NY. Over 1,000 pounds of vegetables are harvested annually.

On-Site Food Waste Compost System

St. John's began composting food waste in 2009. In 2011, through the Office of Sustainability, student workers built a large-scale aerated static pile (ASP) three-bin composting facility. Each day during academic semesters, student workers pick up about 1,000 pounds of preconsumer and postconsumer food waste from five campus kitchens and process it through a pulper machine. Each week, the pulped food waste is mixed with wood chips and loaded into one of three ASP (6-cubic yard) bins. After three weeks in the ASP followed by 10 weeks in winnow, the compost is then screened/finished and applied to the campus grounds. Annually, St. John's recovers about 42 tons of food waste and paper napkins for composting and mixes it with 12 tons of wood chips.

Compost Tea Brewing and Application

Compost made on-site is also used in compost tea brewing. After brewing the tea, organic solutions and minerals are added and the tea is applied /sprayed to the soils in campus tree and shrub beds. The University conducts compost tea brewing workshops in the spring and fall. These workshops presents a cocurricular opportunity for students and faculty to learn about composting, soil biology, and the soil food web.

Outreach & Marketing

The University engages and strives to partner with numerous organizations. Some of these are; NYC Carbon Challenge; NYS Association of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle; EPA; The Arbor Day Foundation; Association For the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE); Con Edison and; NYSDEC. On-campus, The Sustainability Office  most often communicates with Residence Life, Student Earth Club, Learning Communities, Academic Service Learning, Student Wellness, Campus Ministry, and Human Resources.

St. John’s University Department of Public Safety provides safety and security services to our community 24 hours per day, every day of the year. We work together with our partners on and off campus to create and maintain a safe and secure learning environment for our students, faculty, staff and visitors.

Annual Security and Fire Safety Report

Contact Us

The Department of Public Safety at St. John’s University has been entrusted to create and maintain a safe and secure learning environment for the University community. We accomplish this mission in partnership with the entire University community. The Department of Public Safety Command Center is located on the Queens, NY campus at the ROTC Building/McDonald Center. There are additional Command Centers at our Staten Island and Manhattan campuses.

The Department operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The Public Safety team provides a variety of security, and other related services. The Officers can be seen throughout the campus in marked and unmarked vehicles, scooters, foot patrols, bicycle patrol, and fixed post locations. Officers who are assigned to our Community Engagement Team provide our students with additional training in Active Threat Response, Safety in the City, Bystander Intervention Leadership Training, Operation ID, and participate in other safety related events. Our Command Center is staffed 24/7 and utilizes the latest video and communication technology to monitor conditions, dispatch calls for service, and communicate to our community. All uniformed Public Safety personnel are licensed by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, and receive over 25 hours of annual training in various subjects including crime prevention, diversity and sensitivity awareness, customer service, fire and life safety, and best practices and protocols for security and emergency management. They also receive a working knowledge of all applicable city, state, and federal laws. Our Officers are certified by the American Heart Association in First Aid, CPR, and use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). There is also several staff and officers that are NYS certified Emergency Medical Technicians. All of our Officers are certified by FDNY as Fire Guards, and our supervisors are certified NYC Fire Safety Directors. Many of our members are former law enforcement officers, first responders, and emergency medical technicians that bring a tremendous amount of additional training and experience to the Department.

St. John’s University Department of Public Safety maintains frequent contact with local law enforcement and first responders and conducts training drills with these partners. Additionally, we collaborate with various city, state, and federal agencies to insure a safe and secure environment.

Equity and Inclusion Initiatives

In response to the Equity and Inclusion Council recommendations, the University recently engaged the services of an outside consultant to evaluate the Department of Public Safety’s culture, staffing, operations, workplace, and communication practices.  As a result of their review, the Department of Public Safety will collaborate with Human Resources (i) to ensure that behaviors reflecting an embrace of a culture of equity and inclusion; as well as,  excellence in community engagement are integrated into Public Safety’s hiring, training and performance management practices for all positions and (ii) on candidate sourcing to identify and attract more diverse talent, screen candidates for community engagement competencies, and support the department in making the best hiring selections.  We will update the University community as we implement recommended changes.

In our continuing quest to ensure we are providing the best possible service to the University Community, Public Safety has engaged social justice educators to provide the department with equity and inclusion training.  We are engaging the same team to provide additional training going forward.  In addition to ongoing social justice training, the department will undergo additional customer service training as well.

Need help on how to handle a situation by which you are indirectly affected

We consider you to be members of our University community and a partner in your student’s college experience. You know your student best; Parent and Family Connections is a resource for when you feel your student needs extra support or for when you have a question or concern.

Your student’s journey at St. John’s depends on the support and encouragement of all of us—parents and families, as well as the faculty, administrators, and staff who offer St. John’s programs and services. Sometimes it requires our collective willingness, in just the right moment, to simply let go and watch them take their next steps.

To receive the latest St. John's news and updates designed specifically for parents and families, register for the St. John's Parent and Family  portal.

Our relationship is a partnership. Together, we look forward to connecting with you to support your student’s success story at St. John’s!

Concerned About My Student

The Parent and Family Connections is your direct contact any time you have a concern about your student. For nonemergency concerns, please call 718-990-5783. For all emergencies at any time, please call Public Safety at 718-990-5252.

The administrators and staff in many of the University’s departments are prohibited from speaking with family members due to privacy concerns, so they may redirect families back to their student. Parent and Family Connections is aware there may be times when a family member just needs to discuss a concern about their child to gain a better understanding of the situation and the resources that may be available. We are here to listen and support. The relationship between the Parent and Family Connections and families is a partnership designed to support your student’s success story at St. John’s.

Family members are always encouraged to refer students to contact their Advisor who serves as their liaison for campus resources.

Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Major Finds Home Away from Home at St. John’s

Kew Gardens, NY, native Autumn Hill always felt a special connection to St. John’s University. Her high school dance performances were held on the Queens, NY, campus, and she graduated from high school in Carnesecca Arena. Ultimately, however, it was the ethnic diversity and international flavor of the campus community that drew her here.

“Service is important to me because I’m passionate about helping others and making a positive impact,” she said. “I am so grateful for the blessings I have in my life, and I want that for others.

Nursing, Pharmacy & Health Sciences

While every facet of the health science and health-care fields has a unique set of challenges and rewards, they all focus on helping people live longer, healthier lives. For those who are drawn to health-related careers, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports good news—the overall employment in health-care occupations is expected to grow 13 percent through 2031.

Why St. John's

There’s never been a better time to pursue this field at St. John’s University. Our new Nursing program recently welcomed its first class of students, and the multimillion-dollar St. Vincent Health Sciences Center is scheduled to open in Fall 2024. This state-of-the-art facility will feature active learning classrooms, laboratories, simulation facilities, and collaborative spaces, and will be home to current and future health science programs.

The Social Sciences include a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, economics, geography, history, international relations, political science, psychology, and sociology, and therefore the career path you can take with a degree in these areas is almost limitless. Like the humanities, social sciences allows you to explore various areas of interest, while strengthening your research, writing, and critical thinking skills.

Why St. John's

Whether you pursue one of these social sciences at St. John’s—or a combination of several—you develop a keen understanding of the world around you.

Sport, Hospitality & Fashion

At first glance, the worlds of sports, fashion, and hospitality may seem unrelated, but a closer examination finds that each area offers countless career opportunities—not just on the field of play, the runway, or in the penthouse suite—but behind the scenes, as well.

Why St. John's

St. John’s is in New York City, home to 10 major league sports franchises, as well as the headquarters of Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, and the United States Tennis Association. Our Sport Management majors learn from dedicated and experienced faculty and immerse themselves in the business of sports through internships, guest speakers, and alumni in the field.

For St. John’s students interested in making connections in the world of fashion, there are few cities that compare to New York, which, along with London, England; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France, make up fashion’s “Big 4.” Our faculty work closely with students to ensure that they enter this trillion-dollar industry with the skills and business sense they need to make an impact.

New York City is also a global destination for tourists, business leaders, government officials, and others—making it a remarkable place to learn about the worlds of hospitality, food and beverage, tourism, and event management.

The Arts

While some simply associate the arts with the stage and screen or galleries and museums, the truth is the arts are also widely considered a catalyst for the kind of innovative thinking needed to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems in myriad fields.

Why St. John's

There is no shortage of opportunities to showcase one’s talent and creativity at St. John’s University, from The Little Theatre, home of The Chappell Players theatre organization, to the Dr. M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Art Gallery, where students curate exhibitions. Furthermore, the University’s proximity to New York City translates to extraordinary access to Broadway, world-renowned museums, and countless opportunities to learn about the world—and your place in it.

Request a Transcript

Click to Open

There are three ways you can order a transcript of your academic record at St. John’s University.

Electronic Transcripts (PDF)

Electronic Transcripts (PDF) are now available. Delivery is within hours of the request being processed. Electronic Transcripts are $6.50 per copy, payable by credit card only. St. John’s University has partnered with Parchment for electronic transcript delivery. Click here to order an eTranscript.

PDF transcripts are not available for students or alumni who attended prior to 1990 (please see below).

If you need a form or document included with your transcript, please use the electronic transcript request method of delivery.  You will be able to upload your fully completed documents to be sent along with your transcript.

Requestors will receive an email confirmation when the transcript is available for the recipient to download and another email when the transcript has been downloaded by the recipient.

PDF document delivery is becoming increasingly common across institutions, organizations, and agencies. However, before requesting PDF transcript delivery, please verify that the recipient will accept an electronic transcript. Additionally, it is important that you verify the correct email address for transmission of the transcript.

Official PDF transcripts are transmitted electronically to the recipient and is intended solely for use by the recipient. The official transcript has been digitally signed and therefore contains special characteristics.

The Blue Ribbon Symbol is assurance that the digital certificate is valid, the document is authentic, and the contents of the transcript have not been altered.

If the transcript does not display a valid certification and signature message an invalid digital certificate display means either the digital signature is not authentic, or the document has been altered. The digital signature can also be revoked by the transcript office if there is cause, and digital signatures can expire. A document with an invalid digital signature display should be rejected.

Author Unknown, can have two possible meanings: The certificate is a self-signed certificate or has been issued by an unknown or untrusted certificate authority and therefore has not been trusted, or the revocation check could not complete. If this message is received make sure there is a proper connection to the internet. If there is a connection and the digital signature cannot be validated, reject the document.

Any questions with electronic transcripts please call: 847-716-3005.

Via the Web

Current students may order transcripts via the web by signing into signon.stjohns.edu and clicking on the UIS icon. Under the Student menu click the Student Records link. From the Student Records menu, select Request Printed/Official Transcript and follow the prompts.  Please take special care entering the name and address of the recipient of your transcript.  These will print on the transcript exactly as you enter them. These transcripts will be mailed to the recipient via US mail.

If you need a form or document included with your transcript, please use the electronic transcript request method of delivery.  You will be able to upload your fully completed documents to be sent along with your transcript.

Recent alumni who continue to have access to UIS may also order transcripts online.

Mail-In Requests

New York State's "Enough is Enough" Legislation

Effective October 5, 2015, New York State Legislation Article 129-B requires that, based on selected student conduct findings, all colleges and universities add notations to student transcripts. Through St. John’s University’s student conduct process, students found responsible for crimes of violence, including but not limited to, sexual violence will have the following transcript notations added:

Suspension Notation: Suspended after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation.

Expulsion Notation: Expelled after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation.

Notation if student withdraws from St John’s University while the investigation of the complaint is pending: Withdrew with conduct charges pending.

Those seeking the removal of a transcript notation for a suspension must submit a written appeal to the Office of the Registrar.  All such appeals will be reviewed by the Transcript Appeals Committee comprised of the Dean of Students or designee, the University Registrar or designee, and other University administrators as deemed appropriate. Suspension notations will not be removed prior to one year after the conclusion of the suspension. Expulsion notations are permanent.

If a finding of responsibility is vacated, for any reason, any related transcript notations will be removed.

Transcript Notations:

Significantly, Article 129-B mandates that higher education institutions include notations on the transcripts of students found responsible through the institution’s conduct process for crimes of violence, including, but not limited to, sexual violence, as set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(1)(F)(i)(I)-(VIII) of the Clery Act. Such transcript notations must state “suspended after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation” or “expelled after a finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation,” as applicable. Should the student withdraw from the higher education institution while the investigation of the complaint is pending, his or her transcript must note “withdrew with conduct charges pending.” Higher education institutions must have in place written policies regarding such transcript notations, which, at a minimum,  provide an appeals process for students seeking removal of such notations in accordance with Article 129-B.

Proxy Access

Enrollment and Degree Verification

Click to Open

At St. John's University, student enrollment statuses are routinely transmitted to the National Student Clearinghouse throughout each academic period. Subsequently, the National Student Clearinghouse disseminates this data to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). This information serves as the basis for determining eligibility for Title IV grants and loans, as well as establishing repayment schedules for loans. It is imperative for students to remain informed about their enrollment status for a given term and its implications for their eligibility. Data provided to the National Student Clearinghouse is accessible by guaranty agencies, lenders and institutions who are determined to be authorized users of the data system.

The initial submission of enrollment data for a specific term occurs upon the conclusion of the add/drop period. Subsequent reports are transmitted on a monthly basis throughout the term to accommodate students who may enroll late or withdraw from courses.

Be advised, international students are not included in the reports to the National Student Clearinghouse.

If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact the National Student Clearinghouse via phone (703-742-4200) or fax (703-742-4239).

Third Party Agencies

The National Student Clearinghouse is an authorized agent for St. John’s University and is approved to provide degree and enrollment verifications. If you are a third party agency requesting this information, please visit the National Student Clearinghouse's Verification Services website at https://nscverifications.org/.

Please note that students have the right to opt out of this service. All requests to opt out can be directed to the Office of the Registrar, please email registrars@stjohns.edu, visit the office in person or call 718-990-2000.

Social Security Number

A Public Notice about Social Security Numbers

New York State Education Law prohibits the use of the Social Security number for identification purposes. Additionally, the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) prohibits the release of the Social Security number without a student's prior written consent. Neither the State of New York nor the Federal government requires the release of Social Security numbers except in a few carefully defined situations, chiefly related to verification of entitlement to financial aid.

Because of the above and because the Social Security number is not a part of a student's educational history, the Office of the Registrar at St. John's University does not confirm or in any other way make reference to or reveal a student's Social Security number.

When we confirm or verify a student's enrollment or the award of a degree, we certify academic information that our records contain, information that originates with us and that we have authority over. If, for example, we confirm that St. John's University awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree to Jane Doe on May 15, 2002, we assert that our records indicate that a person with this name received the degree indicated on the noted date. We do not, nor should we, authenticate anyone's identity.

Student Advisement Reports

Click to Open

Student Advisement Reports - DegreeWorks

Student Advisement Reports powered by DegreeWorks is a web-based program that enables you to easily track your academic progress. The report generated by DegreeWorks is an unofficial guide and source of information on degree requirements and GPAs which is a valuable tool for students and their advisors to enhance the advisement process. Students will be able to see how specific program requirements have been met and what courses still need to be taken to fulfill their requirements. Additionally, information on advisement reports is "real-time" - accurate at the point in time the report is run.

Accessing Student Advisement Reports in DegreeWorks

Students may access their Student Advisement Report through signon.stjohns.edu.

Once logged in to signon.stjohns.edu students can click the "DegreeWorks" widget to access the Student Advisement Report. Students will be able to view previous reports, generate a new report, or complete a "What-If Analysis".

Note: Students who started before Summer/Fall 2016 and students enrolled in the Graduate School of Education may access their report by selecting "Advisement Report (CAPP)" under the Student Advisement menu located in UIS after logging into signon.stjohns.edu. Students should follow the prompts to enter the appropriate term and proceed to view previous reports, generate a new report, or complete a "What-If Analysis".

To access captions, please toggle the "CC" button on the right-hand side of the video player.

Accuracy of Student Advisement Reports

Although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of Student Advisement Reports, these reports remain unofficial guides to degree progress. Students and advisors remain responsible for ensuring that all degree requirements are satisfied.

No degree will be automatically awarded based on a Student Advisement Report. Determinations to award or withhold degrees will continue to be made in each of the University's colleges according to its established policies and procedures.

Students should inform their advisors or deans of concerns about the information on their advisement reports.

Reading Student Advisement Reports in DegreeWorks

Student Advisement Reports are divided into different areas. These may vary by program. Typical areas are the major area, the core area, and elective credits applicable to this degree.

About the GPA

For each area, the advisement report gives a GPA, which is calculated solely from the grades in that area. This GPA is accurate for the grades shown but is not an official GPA - it is for informational purposes only.

The "Insufficient" section at the bottom of the advisement report shows all courses that have not been used to satisfy a degree requirement. This includes failed courses and those courses from which a student has withdrawn. These grades may count in a student's official GPA, major GPA, or honors GPA.

Note: The overall and program GPA's shown at the top of the advisement report include all grades in all courses taken.

Checking Your Degree Requirements

If a student has two (2) degrees, a report will need to be executed for each program.

Degree requirements for any given program may remain the same or may change from year to year. Changes may be minor or significant. As changes are coded, the advisement report will automatically take any changes into account.

To see a complete list of currently available programs, select the "What-If Analysis" option.

What-If Analysis

If a student is contemplating switching from their current major to another one a “What-if Analysis” should be run and will displays academic requirements for that major. The “What-if Analysis” feature shows how many program requirements have already been satisfied if a change of major is of interest. A “What-if Analysis” may be run against any available program.

Course Program of Study (CPoS)

Click to Open

What is CPoS?

Course program of study (CPoS) is a process designed to ensure that students are enrolled in classes that apply to their degree program of study.

CPoS reviews a student’s course registration for each term and compares it to the requirements of their degree program. Courses are flagged as degree applicable or not degree applicable.

CPoS helps students remain on track to graduate timely while keeping them eligible for their federal and/or state aid programs.

Make Sure Your Courses Count!

Federal and New York state regulations require that coursework be degree applicable for aid consideration.

Before registering for courses each semester review your Degree Works audit report and review your semester course registration plan with your academic advisor.

Timely Degree completion minimizes overall degree costs and student debt.

Common Questions and Answers

How will a student know if their courses count in the degree program?

Students should check their Degree Works audit to review required courses and remaining courses needed to complete their degree.

What happens if a student enrolls in courses that are not required to complete their degree?

Students that choose to enroll in courses that are not required to complete their degree could see their financial aid prorated and/or cancelled.

Can students still take courses not required for their degree?

Yes, students may take a course that is not required. Just know that the course will not count toward the financial aid enrollment status and may affect aid eligibility. Students should be prepared to pay for courses without federal and or state aid.

Do students have to be enrolled full-time to receive financial aid?

Enrollment Impact of Federal Aid

In most cases, full-time enrollment is not required to receive federal aid.

The Federal Pell grant, TEACH Grant, Federal Work-Study Program and SEOG Program, don’t require fulltime enrollment, but the student’s enrollment status does affect the amount a student receives.

o    Pell recipients must be fulltime to receive the maximum grant. Pell eligibility for less than half time depends on the students estimated family contribution (EFC).

Half time is required for federal student loans consideration and for loan deferment.

Enrollment Impact on New York State Aid:

New York TAP and state scholarship recipients must be enrolled in 12 credits that are applicable toward their degree requirements to be eligible for their awards.

Students receiving APTS need to insure that all their credits are applicable toward degree requirements.

Enrollment Impact on Institutional Aid:

Institutional aid offered based on a student’s fulltime progress towards degree completion. Students receiving institutional aid are encouraged to complete their degree programs in a timely fashion and are reminded that in addition to basic eligibility requirements most academic scholarships are limited to four continuous academic years of study.

How are Enrollment statuses defined?

Undergraduate: Fulltime = 12 credits or more, Three Quarter = 9-11, Halftime = 6-8, Less than half time = <6

Graduate: Fulltime = 9 credits or more, Halftime = 6-9, less than half time = <6

Law: Fulltime = 11 credits or more, Halftime = 6-9, less than halftime = <6

What if I plan to study abroad for a semester?

The courses taken abroad must be applicable towards degree requirements to count toward a student’s financial aid enrollment status for federal and state aid programs.

What if I have a minor?

If a student’s degree program requires electives these electives can be used to determine a student’s enrollment status for financial aid; however if the student declares a minor only the number of electives needed to fulfill the degree elective requirement are eligible for financial aid consideration regardless of the number of electives required to fulfill the minor.

Examples of how financial aid is impacted

The following serves as examples of how financial aid is impacted depending on the number of credits in which the student is enrolled in and credits that are NOT applicable towards their degree (major or minor).

Total Enrolled Credits   Federal Aid NYS Aid 15   % of Eligibility % of Eligibility Credits Applicable toward Degree Credits NOT Applicable towards Degree     12 3 100% 100% Since the student is enrolled in a minimum of 12 credits that are applicable towards their degree, the student is considered full time and eligible for 100% of Federal and State aid

Total Enrolled Credits   Federal Aid NYS Aid 15   % of Eligibility % of Eligibility Credits Applicable toward Degree Credits NOT Applicable towards Degree but applicable to minor only     9 3 75% 0% Since the student is enrolled in only 9 credits of coursework applicable to their degree for federal aid purposes only 9 credits will be taken into account in determining federal aid eligibility. NYS does not consider a student to be enrolled full time, unless all 12 credits are applicable towards their degree. Therefore, the student does NOT qualify for NYS aid.

Total Enrolled Credits   Federal Aid NYS Aid 12   % of Eligibility % of Eligibility Credits Applicable toward Degree Credits NOT Applicable towards Degree     9 3 75% 0% Because only 9 out of 12 credits are applicable towards the degree, federal financial aid will only pay for 9 credits worth of educational expenses. NYS does not consider a student to be enrolled full time, unless all 12 credits are applicable towards their degree. Therefore, the student does NOT qualify for NYS aid.

Total Enrolled Credits   Federal Aid NYS Aid 15   % of Eligibility % of Eligibility Credits Applicable toward Degree Credits NOT Applicable towards Degree     9 6 75% 0% Because only 9 out of 15 credits are applicable towards the degree, federal financial aid will only pay for 9 credits worth of educational expenses. NYS does not consider a student to be enrolled full time, unless all 12 credits are applicable towards their degree. Therefore, the student does NOT qualify for NYS aid.

Total Enrolled Credits   Federal Aid NYS Aid 12   % of Eligibility % of Eligibility Credits Applicable toward Degree Credits NOT Applicable towards Degree     6 6 50% 0% Because only 6 out of 12 credits are applicable towards the degree, federal financial aid will only pay for 6 credits worth of educational expenses. NYS does not consider a student to be enrolled full time, unless all 12 credits are applicable towards their degree. Therefore, the student does NOT qualify for NYS aid.

New York State Requirement for Distance Education

A Catholic university, St. John’s was founded in 1870 by the Congregation of the Mission (also known as the Vincentians). Today the Vincentian spirit lives in our students, faculty, administrators, and staff who performed nearly 140 000 hours of service in one year alone.  Whether volunteering at service Plunges in the US and abroad, at local soup kitchens, or on Midnight Runs in the streets of Manhattan, our St. John’s family devotes intellectual and physical resources to seek out the causes of poverty and social injustice and find practical meaningful solutions.

Faith and Mission

Expect to win.

Whether you're a student-athlete, a weekend warrior, or simply a fan — there are plenty of ways to get in the game at St. John's. St. John's is home to 17 Division I teams, and our men's basketball team plays select home games at Madison Square Garden. We also offer club and intramural sports, from bowling to eSports.

We are New York's Team

An alumni network that opens doors.

The St. John’s story is the story of New York, and our alumni are woven into the fabric of our city and our world.

How To Contact Us

The Office of Student Financial Services is committed to providing students and their families with the information they need to navigate and understand the financial aid and payment process. We hope the information provided here will prove useful and convenient to access.

File for Financial Aid

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA® ) is now available for the 2024-2025 Academic Year. New Students for the 2024–25 Academic Year should file as soon as possible. Priority FAFSA Deadline for Continuing Students for the 2024-2025 Academic Year is March 15, 2024.

To apply for financial aid for the 2024–25 academic year, students are encouraged to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form as soon as possible. Go to studentaid.gov or call 1-800-4FEDAID for more information.

Remember the FAFSA needs to be filed annually and must be filed by the last day of student’s enrollment within the academic year.

The FAFSA® IS CHANGING!

2024-25 FAFSA® was released December 31, 2023 rather than the traditional timeframe of October 1st. The FAFSA Simplification Act prioritized simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) application process, resulting in changes to the 2024–25 FAFSA® form, process, and methodologies for determining eligibility for federal aid. St. John's University along with all higher education institutions expect to begin receiving 2024-25 completed student FAFSA® information by the second half of March.   Learn more at studentaid.gov.

Announcements and Updates

March 2023 Update from the Office of Equity and Inclusion

Click to Open

Over the past two years, St. John’s University has taken several steps to honor our pledge to promote antiracism and ensure that our community is a place of belonging and inclusion where all members feel welcome. As we continue to witness the senseless acts of injustice, racial hostility, and pain across our country, the sense of urgency and need to align all facets of St. John’s with our standing principles are ever the more urgent.

To that end, I am pleased to share that the Board of Trustees voted at its meeting on February 15—in recognition of the newly established Office of Equity and Inclusion—that a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee would be formed as part of its accountability structure. This group will be at the forefront of the Board’s ongoing efforts to promote antiracism and a diverse and inclusive University community.

We all know nothing much happens without leadership—and ensuring diverse, inclusive, and equitable practices is no different. In fact, leaders on these issues need to exemplify what is being asked of others: authenticity, courage, curiosity, humility, introspection, self-awareness, and vulnerability, to name a few characteristics. Rev. Brian J. Shanley, O.P., President, and William J. Janetschek ’84CBA, ’17HON, Board Chair, will visibly support this work and serve as members of the committee.

Chaired by Board member Tarik S. Turner ’98C, the DEI Committee is charged to

support and monitor the University’s key strategic efforts related to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion goals;

advise the Board of Trustees about emerging issues and the activities and resources associated with meeting the University’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals;

oversee the development and implementation of educational programming related to racism—especially issues of structural or systemic racism in the United States—and its continuing effects within higher education and the University; and

monitor the demographics and working conditions of employees; the enrollment and educational climate of students; and, at least annually, review reports on the demographics of University students, faculty, administrators, and staff.

The current members of the DEI Committee are

Stephon Barnes, Chief Operating Officer, CFI Partners, LLC

Celebrating Pride 2022

Click to Open

As many of you know, June is LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, commemorating the first Pride protest which was led outside the Stonewall Inn in New York in 1969.

There are a variety of ways to celebrate Pride this year, with many events resuming in person. For anyone looking to get involved in a meaningful way—from parades to 5ks to social action—the University’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) has compiled a Pride Month 2022 Resource Guide as a helpful starting point.

In addition, a prerecorded webinar is available on the EAP member website, www.myccaonline.com (company code: stjohns). Titled “#PrideIncluded: LGBTQIA+ Inclusivity and Equity,” the session encourages participants to explore their roles in promoting inclusion and acceptance in the community and the workplace.

As we celebrate Pride, we also acknowledge the challenges that the LGBTQIA+ community continues to face today. We encourage the LGBTQIA+ members of our St. John’s community to practice self-care and surround yourselves with people who love you, believe in you, cheer for you, and listen to you. However you choose to honor Pride Month, we hope your celebrations are safe and meaningful.

Employee Resource Groups

Click to Open

In the Fall of 2020, the University announced the launch of formal Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) at St. John’s. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that help to foster an equitable and inclusive workplace, as well as cultivate a greater sense of belonging. ERGs are open to all St. John’s University faculty, administrators, and staff. An ERG may form around a shared identity, a shared interest or concern, or a professional/career affiliation.

Preference in the initial launch will be shown to ERGs that support minoritized social identities in our workplace.  An ERG Proposal Form and Getting Started Guide, along with a comprehensive ERG Guidebook and other program resources, are available on St. John’s Connect. To learn more, login to St. John's Connect and click on Campus Resources. From the Resources header, click the "Employee Information" icon and then "Employee ERGs."

Employees who are interested in starting a group are encouraged to review the ERG resources, and then identify two coleaders to complete the required proposal information online. Should you have questions, a Human Resources representative can be reached at ERG@stjohns.edu.

University Crest

The redesigned crest restores the original blue and red, liturgical colors evoking the “Blessed Virgin and the Humanity of Her Divine Son.” The white cross at its center further identifies Christ as the foundation and model for a moral, ethical character, as does the motto Ecce Agnus (“Behold the Lamb of God”), recalling St. John the Baptist’s testimony to the divinity of Christ. The fleur-de-lis symbolizes France, homeland of St. Vincent de Paul. The heart represents his commitment to charity. The escalloped shell—an ancient symbol of the sacrament of baptism—signifies St. James the Greater, titular of the cathedral of the Diocese of Brooklyn, where the University was founded. The shell also recalls a Native American name for Long Island: “Sewanhacky” (“Island of Shells”).

Especially prominent is the banner encircling the lower half of the crest. It bears the motto “Educatio Christiana Animae Perfectio” (“Christian education perfects the soul”), a testament to the ethos that guides St. John's University.

Green Initiatives & Eco-Friendly Practices

Sustainability is a long-term responsibility to meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. The environment has a limit and it must be respected and embraced. At St. John's, our Sustainability Coordinators work together to promote a more sustainable campus.

Climate Action Plan

St. John’s is on the path with a roadmap to achieve 50 percent carbon emissions reduction from energy consumed by buildings by year 2030. Within the new NYC Climate Mobilization Act of 2019 there are tiered emissions compliance targets for 2024 and 2030. Being below the emissions limits for 2024, St. John’s is developing plans to meet its 2030 emissions limit and includes renewable energy sources such as geothermal and solar power.

St. John’s Energy Master Plan 2017 can be viewed here.

Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, & Rating System™ (STARS)

STARS, developed by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, is a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance. STARS ratings last three years. As a Charter Participant in STARS, St. John's achieved a Silver rating in 2011 and upgraded to a Gold rating in 2012 and 2016.

Categories of the STARS 2.0 Technical Manual

Academics Curriculum Research Operations Air and Climate Buildings Dining Services Energy Grounds Purchasing Transportation Waste Water Engagement Campus Engagement Public Engagement Planning and Administration Coordination, Planning, and Governance Diversity and Affordability Health, Wellbeing, and Work Investment Innovation

Student Involvement

The Office of Sustainability partners with Residence Life to engage students in their dorms to live more sustainably through recycling enhancements and energy conservation. Events include an Energy Reduction Tournament “Conserve to Serve,” Move-out Food and Clothing Collection, Earth Week, Train the Trainer program with Resident Assistants, Campus Sustainability Day, Battle of Buildings for Spirit, RecycleMania, Campaigns for Awareness and Involvement, and Green-Handed Raffles.

Municipal Solid Waste & Recycling

St. John's participates in RecycleMania, a spring semester, eight-week, nationwide tournament involving more than 400 schools. The University reached a diversion rate of 50 percent for RecycleMania 2017 and achieved the RecycleMania’s national title in the Food Waste Reduction category for the Campus Engagement Case Study Competition.

At St. John's, recycling and food waste reduction efforts are ongoing, and include implementation of single stream recycling, enhancements to hardware (bins and signage), staff retraining, and food waste recovery. Help change a culture of waste by making recycling and waste reduction a top priority.

Student Sustainability Coordinators

Since 2008, St. John's has maintained a team of student workers as Sustainability Coordinators. These students perform a variety of tasks, from policing campus-wide recycling of municipal solid waste to running campaigns for student involvement in energy conservation. These workers perform daily collection of food waste to generate on-site composting, as well as maintain the organic garden and run numerous special events.

EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge (FRC) Program

St. John's is a charter participant in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s FRC program, which has three primary actions: food waste prevention; food recovery for donation; and food waste composting.

Food Waste Compost System

Annually, St. John's composts on-site over 100 tons of food waste (95% of all campus food waste). The Office of Sustainability with student workers built and operate an aerated static pile (ASP) three-bin composting system.  Source separation is done by Chartwells Dining Service, then, food waste (1,000 pounds per day) is processed through a pulper machine. Each week, the pulped food waste is mixed with wood chips and loaded into one of three ASP composting bins. After three weeks in the ASP followed by 12 weeks in winnow, the compost can then screened/finished and applied to the campus grounds.

Food Recovery

St. John's is a registered Chapter in Food Recovery Network and with the help of Chartwells Dining Service, annually recovers over 6,000 pounds of good prepared food for donation to help alleviate hunger.

Tree Campus USA Program

St. John's received Tree Campus USA participation awards for the past s seven years by meeting the program criteria of tree care committee; tree care plan; finding the tree care program; incorporation of Academic Service-Learning (ASL); and Annual Arbor Day observance / event. The Queens campus has over 3,000 trees, 500 of which came from the NYC Million Trees project (2008–11). With faculty over site, in 2013 students planted a northeast native species campus arboretum around the softball field. Each year, the University's Campus Tree Mapping Project grows with the help of students guided by dedicated faculty member Paula Lazrus. Currently there are more than 1,000 trees mapped. You can view the progress of the University's Tree Mapping Project at https://sju.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=e93c6f15a2b24969bf5ab32fa20d2955.

Student Community Garden

The student community garden is an organic vegetable garden built and maintained by student workers and the Student Earth Club. The garden consists of more than 50 semi-raised planting beds with organic soils, automatic irrigation, and central drainage system. Students harvest and deliver the vegetables to help support St. John’s Bread & Life soup kitchen in Brooklyn, NY. Over 1,000 pounds of vegetables are harvested annually.

On-Site Food Waste Compost System

St. John's began composting food waste in 2009. In 2011, through the Office of Sustainability, student workers built a large-scale aerated static pile (ASP) three-bin composting facility. Each day during academic semesters, student workers pick up about 1,000 pounds of preconsumer and postconsumer food waste from five campus kitchens and process it through a pulper machine. Each week, the pulped food waste is mixed with wood chips and loaded into one of three ASP (6-cubic yard) bins. After three weeks in the ASP followed by 10 weeks in winnow, the compost is then screened/finished and applied to the campus grounds. Annually, St. John's recovers about 42 tons of food waste and paper napkins for composting and mixes it with 12 tons of wood chips.

Compost Tea Brewing and Application

Compost made on-site is also used in compost tea brewing. After brewing the tea, organic solutions and minerals are added and the tea is applied /sprayed to the soils in campus tree and shrub beds. The University conducts compost tea brewing workshops in the spring and fall. These workshops presents a cocurricular opportunity for students and faculty to learn about composting, soil biology, and the soil food web.

Outreach & Marketing

The University engages and strives to partner with numerous organizations. Some of these are; NYC Carbon Challenge; NYS Association of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle; EPA; The Arbor Day Foundation; Association For the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE); Con Edison and; NYSDEC. On-campus, The Sustainability Office  most often communicates with Residence Life, Student Earth Club, Learning Communities, Academic Service Learning, Student Wellness, Campus Ministry, and Human Resources.

In response to the Equity and Inclusion Council recommendations, the University recently engaged the services of an outside consultant to evaluate the Department of Public Safety’s culture, staffing, operations, workplace, and communication practices.  As a result of their review, the Department of Public Safety will collaborate with Human Resources (i) to ensure that behaviors reflecting an embrace of a culture of equity and inclusion; as well as,  excellence in community engagement are integrated into Public Safety’s hiring, training and performance management practices for all positions and (ii) on candidate sourcing to identify and attract more diverse talent, screen candidates for community engagement competencies, and support the department in making the best hiring selections.  We will update the University community as we implement recommended changes.

In our continuing quest to ensure we are providing the best possible service to the University Community, Public Safety has engaged social justice educators to provide the department with equity and inclusion training.  We are engaging the same team to provide additional training going forward.  In addition to ongoing social justice training, the department will undergo additional customer service training as well.

If you ever need assistance regarding sexual assault, please visit Sexual Assault: You Are Not Alone.

What Is Title IX?

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from sex discrimination in educational programs and activities at institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence, and sexual misconduct.

St. John's University is committed to providing an environment that is free from all forms of discrimination on the basis of sex and offers many resources to students, faculty, administrators, and staff to address concerns relating to discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity.

Who Are the Title IX Coordinators?

Danielle Haynes, Interim Director of Equal Opportunity and Compliance and Title IX Coordinator, serves as the Title IX Coordinator for overall campus compliance for the University. In this role, she monitors and maintains overall compliance with University policies and procedures in preventing, addressing, and remediating all forms of discrimination and harassment.

Additionally, Ms. Haynes works with the Title IX Deputy Coordinators, to investigate and respond to each complaint and monitor incidents to ensure remediation and continued compliance. The Title IX Deputy Coordinators also identify and address any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints. Thus, the Title IX Deputy Coordinators play an integral role in carrying out the University's commitment to providing a positive learning, teaching and working environment for the entire University community.

Ms. Haynes' office is located on the Queens campus in the Office of Human Resources, University Center, and she can be contacted at 718-990-2660 or haynesd1@stjohns.edu.

Jackie Lochrie, Dean of Students, serves as the Title IX Deputy Coordinator for the Division of Student Success. Ms. Lochrie's office is located on the Queens campus in The Peter J. Tobin College of Business, Garden Level, and she can be contacted at 718-990-6568 or lochriej@stjohns.edu.

Kristin Quinn, Senior Associate Athletic Director/Senior Women Administrator, serves as the Title IX Deputy Coordinator for Athletics. Ms. Quinn's can be contacted at 718-990-6736 or quinnk@stjohns.edu.

When Should I Contact a Title IX Coordinator?

Any student, faculty, administrator, staff member, or applicant for admission who has concerns about sex discrimination including sexual harassment, sexual violence, or sexual misconduct is encouraged to seek the assistance of a Title IX Coordinator.

For example, we encourage you to contact a Title IX Coordinator if you:

Wish to understand your options if you think you may have encountered sex discrimination or sexual misconduct

Learn of a situation that you feel may warrant a University investigation

Need help on how to handle a situation by which you are indirectly affected

Seek guidance on possible methods of de-escalating or alleviating a difficult situation

Have questions on St. John's policies and procedures

You can get more information about Title IX and the University's Policies online at:

Notice of Non-Discrimination, Equal Opportunity

Student Conduct: Code of Conduct and Conduct Process

Student Handbook, Section 3: Policies and Procedures

It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with Title IX and the University policies associated with sexual harassment, assault, and gender bias/discrimination. Please review these policies to ensure that you are fully informed of your rights and your responsibilities as a member of our University community.

Today teachers must be prepared to work with students with diverse needs and abilities. The inclusion movement mandates placing special education students in general education classrooms, regardless of their disability. This mandate changes special education from a pull-out to a pull-in program. According to Dr. Sally Smith, Director of the Lab School in Washington, DC, inclusion will make it necessary for the general education and special education teachers to co-teach. They will plan lessons and teach together and share responsibilities for assessing a student’s mastery of skills and socialization.
