We strive to preserve and enhance an atmosphere in which scholarly research, imaginative methodology, global awareness, and an enthusiastic quest for truth serve as the basis of a vital teaching-learning process and the development of lifelong learning. Our core curriculum in the liberal arts and sciences aims to enrich lives as well as professions and serves to unify the undergraduate experience. Graduate and professional schools express our commitment to research, rigorous standards, and innovative application of knowledge. We aim not only to be excellent professionals with an ability to analyze and articulate clearly what is, but also to develop the ethical and aesthetic values to imagine and help realize what might be.</p><p>St. John’s is a Catholic university, founded in 1870 in response to an invitation of the first Bishop of Brooklyn, John Loughlin, to provide the youth of the city with an intellectual and moral education. We embrace the Judaeo-Christian ideals of respect for the rights and dignity of every person and each individual’s responsibility for the world in which we live. We commit ourselves to create a climate patterned on the life and teaching of Jesus Christ as embodied in the traditions and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Our community, which comprises members of many faiths, strives for an openness which is “wholly directed to all that is true, all that deserves respect, all that is honest, pure, admirable, decent, virtuous, or worthy of praise” (Philippians 4:8). Thus, the university is a place where the Church reflects upon itself and the world as it engages in dialogue with other religious traditions.</p><p>St. John’s is a Vincentian university, inspired by St. Vincent de Paul’s compassion and zeal for service. We strive to provide excellent education for all people, especially those lacking economic, physical, or social advantages. Community service programs combine with reflective learning to enlarge the classroom experience. Wherever possible, we devote our intellectual and physical resources to search out the causes of poverty and social injustice and to encourage solutions which are adaptable, effective, and concrete. In the Vincentian tradition, we seek to foster a world view and to further efforts toward global harmony and development by creating an atmosphere in which all may imbibe and embody the spirit of compassionate concern for others so characteristic of Vincent.</p><p>St. John’s is a metropolitan and global university. We benefit from New York City’s cultural diversity, its intellectual and artistic resources, and its unique professional educational opportunities. With this richness comes responsibility. We encourage the metropolitan community to use our resources to serve its needs. As a global university, we are one of our nation's most diverse institutions of higher education, enriched by a mixture of cultures which complements an internationalized curriculum. Through collaboration with other institutions around the world, study abroad opporunities, and online courses and degrees, our outreach spans the globe. In educating students we pledge to foster those qualities needed for our alumni to become effective leaders and responsible citizens in a vibrant city and dynamic world.</p><p>Mission Statement of St. John’s University, New York<br>Approved by the Board of Trustees, October 7, 2015</p><hr><h3>Core Values</h3><p>The Vincentian tradition at St. John’s University is the foundation and the source of the core values its members strive to embody: truth, love, respect, opportunity, excellence and service.</p><p><strong>Truth</strong><br><strong>Knowledge in accord with reality, behavior faithful to ethical standards.</strong> St. John’s affirms the threefold mission of a university to seek truth through research, to disseminate it through teaching and to act on it. The University values and utilizes the perspectives of different cultures to assist its members in seeking truth and developing ethical standards, while affirming the Judaeo-Christian tradition.</p><p><strong>Love</strong><br><strong>Focusing and extending minds and hearts to nurture one’s own and another’s good. </strong>Love expressed in the University community is not a feeling but an action for the corporate good manifested through the time, talent and energy of its members. It is a responsible dedication to utilize available resources and turn them towards humanity’s good.</p><p><strong>Respect</strong><br><strong>Awareness of and esteem for all individuals.</strong> A courteous regard for all people whose diversity is embraced and shared in learning, teaching and service to others within the University community and beyond.</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong><br><strong>Circumstances favorable to serving others and preparing one’s self for a fulfilling life. </strong>Guided by its central commitment to equality, justice and Christian morality, the University makes its resources available to all its members to pursue their individual and collective interests.</p><p><strong>Excellence</strong><br><strong>Striving, growing, never being complacent.</strong> The St. John’s Community empowers and inspires students, staff, faculty and administration to succeed in programs which assist them in every area of achievement.</p><p><strong>Service</strong><br><strong>Vincentian spirituality in action, a response to God’s call to give of ourselves.</strong> Our obligation and commitment to service lie not only in our active compassion as an institution, but in the cultivation of these priorities and values in the members of our community. We are committed to a life of stewardship as a caretaker of God-given talents, resources and knowledge, and caregiver responding to the needs of others.</p><hr><h3>Strategic Pillars</h3><ol><li>Student Success: Reimagining the Student Experience to Deepen Connection, Engagement and Belonging</li><li>Academic Distinction: Excellence in Teaching Learning, and Research</li><li>Mission, Equity, and Inclusion: Building a Community of Belonging</li><li>Institutional Resources: Growing and Optimizing Institutional Assets</li><li>The St. John's Identity: Elevating our National and Global Structure</li></ol><p>View the <a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/five-year-plan-st-johns-future">University's Five-Year Plan</a>&nbsp;for the future.</p><hr><h3>University Crest</h3><p>St. John’s University Crest embodies its heritage. The cross proposes Christ as the center and model for moral and ethical character. The book, a symbol of learning, bears the words, <em><strong>Ecce Agnus</strong></em> (Behold the Lamb of God), the testimony of St. John the Baptist to the divinity of Christ. The heart is the symbol of the charity of St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the Vincentians. The <em><strong>fleur-de-lis</strong></em> represents France, the birthplace of St. Vincent, and reminds the University of its dedication to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.</p><p>The escalloped shell, an ancient symbol for the sacrament of baptism, also signifies St. James the Greater, titular of the cathedral of the Diocese of Brooklyn, the diocese in which the University was founded. In addition, the shell suggests an Indian name for Long Island, “Sewanhacky,” or Island of Shells.</p><p>The motto <em><strong>Educatio Christiana Animae Perfectio</strong></em>, (Christian Education Perfects the Soul) is from <em><strong>Divini illius magistri</strong></em>, the encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Christian Education.</p><hr><h3>University Seal</h3><p>The Official Seal of St. John’s University sets down symbolically the purposes of the University.</p><p>The outer register of the Seal bears the legend <em>Sigillum Universitatis Sti. Joannis Neo-Eboraci</em> (The Seal of St. John’s University, New York).</p><p>The inner register contains a Greek text (John V:35) uttered by the Divine Teacher, Jesus Christ, in praise of St. John the Baptist, the patron of the University: (He was the lamp, burning and shining). The founding date of St. John’s, 1870, is included in this band.</p><p>The central portion of the Seal displays three books surmounted by a burning lamp symbolizing the educational aims of St. John’s University. The three are identified by Latin titles: <em>Religio</em> (Religion), <em>Humanitas</em> (Culture), and <em>Scientia</em> (Knowledge). The burning lamp is symbolic of the University patron, St. John the Baptist.</p><hr><h3>What Does it Mean to Be Vincentian?</h3><p><img style="float:right;" alt height="220" src="/sites/default/files/pages/hero/st-vincent.jpg" width="220" loading="lazy">St. John’s University looks to St. Vincent de Paul (1581-1660), founder of the Congregation of the Mission, for its vision and inspiration. From southern France, Vincent pursued the priesthood as a way to assure a comfortable life. Through a profound conversion experience in his early ministry, Vincent unraveled the central paradox of life: it is in giving that one receives. In a Paris marked by great affluence enjoyed by a few as well as by dire poverty endured by the masses, Vincent discovered that one finds God and oneself in service to others. A man of deep faith, keen intellect, great business acumen and enormous creativity, he was at home in the hovels of the poor and in the palaces of royalty. Respected by the powerful and loved by the poor, Vincent bridged social classes through his works of charity and his advocacy for the disenfranchised.</p><p>In collaboration with St. Louise de Marillac (1591-1660), Vincent organized hospitals for the sick poor, founded asylums for the orphaned, opened workshops for the unemployed, championed literacy for the uneducated, advocated for the incarcerated, established local charities and reformed the education and formation of the clergy throughout France, where his community of priests and brothers undertook the spiritual care of the poor, particularly those in rural areas.</p><p>In 1870 in the United States, the Bishop of Brooklyn asked the Vincentian community to establish an institution of higher education for the rapidly expanding immigrant community of New York. Denied access to other institutions, the children of immigrants, particularly those from Europe and the British Isles, found financial support and academic challenge, as well as respect and opportunity, in St. John’s College on Lewis Avenue in Brooklyn. While St. John’s University moved from the Brooklyn sites in the mid-twentieth century and now has several campuses where students from many cultures learn and work together, the Vincentians still offer a range of services to the local community in Bedford Stuyvesant, the site of the first St. John’s.</p><p>Today, as a <a href="/who-we-are/history-and-facts/vincentian-heritage" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d62f0cf-b7ef-4c0f-8f14-b02d2ee17b24" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Vincentian Heritage">Vincentian university</a>, St. John’s extends Vincent’s vision and continues his unflagging efforts for the poor and needy. New employees are introduced to the Vincentian message during a Vincentian Mission Orientation program, which is also offered to current employees. All at St. John’s are inheritors of Vincent’s legacy and stewards of his mission to respect each person, serve the needy and build human solidarity.</p><hr><h3>About St. John's - Facts, Figures and Historical Highlights</h3><p><img style="float:right;" alt height="169" src="/sites/default/files/pages/hero/farm-house.jpg" width="220" loading="lazy"><strong>Inside the Numbers . . .</strong><br>As an employee and, therefore, a representative of St. John’s, you should be aware of the <a href="/node/5491">facts, figures and historical highlights</a> that make up the University profile and which have helped to shape the University over the years.

If you and your supervisor agree that you will enter into a flexible work arrangement, you would need to complete and sign the agreement form.</p><ul><li><strong>Hybrid Work:</strong> This type of flexible work arrangement allows an employee to work from home or another approved off-site location. A combination of on-site and off-site work may also be arranged under this option. Refer to the University's <a href="/my-st-johns/human-resources/policy-130-hybrid-work-policy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e4c493dc-1c55-406d-a229-a1939fc5b36b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Policy 130 - Hybrid Work Policy">hybrid work policy</a>&nbsp;for information and eligibility for telework.</li><li><strong>Job Share:</strong> This arrangement is a form of regular part-time work in which two employees&nbsp;share the responsibilities of one regular full-time position. Job sharing positions are regular part-time and as such, must involve at least a 50% commitment from each member.</li><li><strong>Flextime:</strong> This flexible scheduling arrangement permits variations in daily beginning and ending times, but does not alter the total number of hours worked in a day and in a workweek. For example: under the flextime option, an employee whose normal work hours are from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. may arrange to work 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. instead.</li><li><strong>Compressed Workweek:</strong> The compressed workweek allows an employee to complete the standard full-time weekly hours in fewer than five days per week. This arrangement is most conducive to non-exempt employees who work a standard 35, 37.5 or 40 hour workweek. An example of a compressed work arrangement for a 35-hour workweek might be Monday-Wednesday with hours from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Thursday with hours from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The compressed workweek option does not apply during summer months if the University is closed on Fridays.</li><li><strong>Reduced Schedule:</strong> In this arrangement an employee works full-time hours each week, but for a period less than twelve months per year (but not less than nine months). Typically, these positions extend through the academic year (September 1 through May 31) in a consecutive nine-month period; however, they may have other beginning and ending dates, depending on the particular needs of the job, the employee and the department.</li></ul><p>Detailed information can be found in the <a href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>, policy #115 Flexible Work Arrangements.</p><hr><h3>Opportunities for Growth and Development</h3><p><strong>Transfer and Promotion</strong><br>You are encouraged to pursue opportunities for professional growth and development at St. John’s.

At St. John’s we believe that performance management is a cyclical and collaborative process between you and your supervisor that gives you direction, encourages coaching and feedback, and fosters two-way communication.</p><p>RED is the name of the University’s comprehensive performance management process. The key elements include:</p><ul><li>Setting Objectives/Key Responsibilities</li><li>Understanding how Values and Mission can be expressed through the Competencies)</li><li>Development Planning</li><li>Ongoing coaching and communication between your supervisor and you</li><li>Assessment discussions and completion of the annual appraisal form (RED form)</li></ul><p>RED has many benefits for you. Some of the ways you can benefit are by:</p><ul><li>Knowing what is expected of your role/position.</li><li>Seeing how your job supports the larger University mission and strategy.</li><li>Providing input on how to do your job more effectively.</li><li>Communicating more frequently with your supervisor about your job performance.</li><li>Being acknowledged for exceptional performance</li><li>Developing in areas that need improvement.</li><li>Identifying career interests and mapping an approach for development.</li><li>Having clear objectives.</li></ul><p>For more information on RED, speak with your supervisor, visit the <a href="/who-we-are/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-services" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a15c1bb1-e2eb-48b5-ac8e-c7a9e7d544df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Human Resources Services">Human Resources Services</a> web page or call HR Services at 718-990-1502. Performance management is not intended to create and does not create an employment contract or guarantee of continued employment for any employees, nor does it alter the at-will employment relationship between the University and its administrative and staff employees. Both the University and its employees have the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or reason.</p><p><strong>Preparing for Performance Discussions with Your Supervisor</strong><br>You should think of performance management as a continuous process, and not a one-time event. Throughout the performance cycle you and your supervisor will have opportunities to meet both informally and formally to discuss your performance and progress. Below are suggestions that may help you to prepare for formal performance discussions.</p><p><strong>Beginning of the performance cycle</strong></p><ul><li>Prepare for a performance planning discussion with your supervisor by reviewing the RED Form and be prepared to discuss responsibilities and objectives.</li><li>Consider ways you can express the Vincentian Values at work and the University Mission through the Core Competencies described in RED.</li><li>Think about development activities you would like to pursue and discuss them with your supervisor.</li></ul><p><strong>During the performance cycle</strong></p><ul><li>Your supervisor may have periodic check-ins with you to make sure your performance is on track and your Objectives remain relevant. At this time, make sure to update your supervisor on the status of your accomplishments and development activities.</li><li>Periodic check-ins may be necessary when priorities change or when your development plan needs updating. No form is due to HR at this time.</li></ul><p><strong>End of the performance cycle</strong></p><ul><li>After the end of the performance cycle (after June 1), you will receive an email from Human Resources with a link to your RED Form. You have 30 days to complete the Objectives and&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-assessment sections of the form. Refer to the&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-are/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-services" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a15c1bb1-e2eb-48b5-ac8e-c7a9e7d544df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Human Resources Services">Human Resources Services</a> web page for additional guidance and resources.</li><li>As you assess your performance, consider your accomplishments and demonstrated strengths during the entire RED cycle and areas for improvement.</li><li>Your supervisor will complete the final assessment, add ratings and comments and meet with you to review it. You will both sign and date the RED form.</li></ul><p><strong>Eligibility for Increases</strong> (for full-time and regular part-time administrators and staff)</p><p>For information on annual increases and award programs, refer to the section in this Handbook entitled WORK HOURS and COMPENSATION.</p><p>Additional information can be found in the <a href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>, policy #202 Performance Management, and policy #203 Training and Development</p><hr><h3>Leaving the University</h3><p>Make sure to use the Departing Employee Checklist (<a href="/sites/default/files/uploads/Departing%20Employee%20Checklist.pdf">PDF</a>) to help you prepare to separate from the University.</p><p><strong>Categories of Separation</strong><br>The employment of staff and administrators is "at will." This means that both the University and its employees have the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or reason. The University's Employment at Will statement appears above, at the beginning of this section. If you have questions about Employment at Will, you may contact Human Resources Services on the Queens campus at extension 1502 or 718-990-1502.</p><p><strong>Voluntary Termination:</strong> A separation from the University initiated by you, the employee. This can be the result of resignation or retirement.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Resignation:</strong></em> This occurs when you leave your employment at the University on your own initiative. The University expects a minimum of two weeks’ notice of separation; however, a greater notice period is preferred for administrators. Absent extenuating circumstances, if you are not on an approved leave and you fail to report to work for three consecutive business days without notifying the University about your absence, then you may be considered to have voluntarily resigned.</li><li><em><strong>Retirement:</strong></em> This is voluntary separation by an employee who meets the University’s retirement eligibility criteria. You are eligible to retire if you meet <strong>all</strong> of the following — you are at least 55 years old <strong>and</strong> you have at least 10 years of full-time service with St. John’s, <strong>and</strong> your age and years of full-time service combined equal 75 years or more.</li></ul><p><strong>Involuntary Termination:</strong> A separation from employment initiated by the University.</p><ul><li>Reasons for involuntary termination may include, but are not limited to, misconduct, unsatisfactory work performance, absenteeism, insubordination, violations of University policy or rules, dishonesty, illegal acts, conflict of interest, or any act deemed inconsistent with the University’s Mission.</li></ul><p><strong>Exit Interview</strong><br>Should you leave St. John’s employment, an exit interview lets you give feedback about your experiences while working for the University. Full-time employees who voluntarily terminate employment will be contacted by the HR Services office to schedule an exit interview. Individual employee responses to the exit interview questionnaire are confidential, and responses are tracked on an aggregate department-level basis for the purpose of assessing trends to strengthen employee retention efforts.</p><p><strong>Status of Benefits</strong><br>Upon separation from University employment, employees may be eligible for certain benefits. In the case of retirement, refer to <strong>Benefits When You Retire</strong> in the BENEFITS section of this Handbook. In the case of an employee’s death, refer to <strong>Benefits for Survivors</strong>, also located in the BENEFITS section.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Vacation:</strong></em> Upon separation from employment you will be paid for the cash value of any unused accrued vacation time. You will not be paid for vacation time that has not accrued as of the date of termination, and to which you are not otherwise entitled. Unused sick time, personal time and holidays have no cash value.</li><li><em><strong>Health Insurance:</strong></em> Upon separation from employment, if you and any member of your family were enrolled in a University-sponsored medical and/or dental plan, your coverage will continue until the last day of the month in which your employment terminated. You will also be notified of your rights to continue coverage under COBRA, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act.</li><li><em><strong>Life Insurance:</strong></em> Upon separation from employment, if you had life insurance you have the option to convert your group life insurance policy to an individual policy.</li><li><em><strong>Tuition Remission:</strong></em> Benefits cease for you and your spouse/children upon termination. The amount of tuition will be prorated for the semester in which you terminate.</li><li><em><strong>Tuition Exchange Program</strong></em>: TEP benefits at the end of the semester in which the employee terminates.</li><li><em><strong>Retirement Plan:</strong></em> If you participated in a University-sponsored retirement plan, you have several options upon separation from employment, including leaving the accumulated balance in the current account, rolling over the balance into another qualified plan or into an IRA, and making a cash withdrawal. For a copy of the plan documents, which contain more information, contact Benefits at extension 2363 or 718-990-2363.</li><li><em><strong>Long Term Care Insurance:</strong></em> Upon separation from employment, participants who were enrolled can continue coverage.</li></ul><p><strong>Breaks in Service and Rehire</strong><br>If you leave the University, you may be eligible for rehire. Supervisors determine employees’ eligibility for rehire based on the circumstances of separation. Generally, employees who are discharged are not eligible for rehire by the University.</p><p>If you are a former full-time employee and the University rehires you within five (5) years of the date you left, you will receive credit for your prior St. John’s employment time (see exception for VSOs). An adjusted hire date will be used to calculate certain benefits upon rehire, such as vacation accrual rate, long-term disability coverage, and to track eligibility for benefits in retirement. Former part-time years of service are not credited if an employee is rehired. Former employees who accepted and received benefits from a Voluntary Separation Offer (VSO) who are rehired on a full-time basis would not receive credit for any prior time worked at the University. Service would begin to accrue effective the most recent hire date.</p><p>If you are out on an approved leave of absence, you will receive continuous service credit. If you completed at least one year of University employment and were eligible to receive the University’s contribution to the retirement plan, you would be eligible to participate in the plan and receive the University’s contribution on the first of the month following your rehire date.</p><p>If you are rehired within one year to the same position that you held when you were previously employed with the University, you will not have to complete a new three-month Orientation Period. In all other cases, you will be subject to an Orientation Period upon rehire.</p><p>If you are a former full-time employee who was hired by the University on or before June 1, 2000 and rehired for full-time employment within one year of your date of separation, you may be eligible to receive individual medical coverage at no cost. If you are a former full-time employee who was hired by the University on or before June 1, 2000 and rehired for full-time employment within one year of your date of separation, who previously paid for family coverage for two consecutive years, you may not be required to contribute toward the cost of family coverage upon rehire. However, if you did not pay for family coverage during your employment at the University, you will be required to pay the current family contribution rate upon rehire. If you elect to waive medical coverage when you are rehired and later you elect coverage, you will be required to pay the current contribution rate for individual or family coverage. The Benefits Office will determine an employee’s eligibility for these benefits upon rehire. You can reach Benefits at extension 2363 or 718-990-2363.</p><p>For more on service breaks and rehire, contact the <a href="/who-we-are/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-services" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a15c1bb1-e2eb-48b5-ac8e-c7a9e7d544df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Human Resources Services">HR Services</a> office on the Queens campus at extension 1502 or 718-990-1502 or the Recruitment Office at extension 2445 or 718-990-2445.</p><p>Additional information can be found in the <a href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>, policy #125 Separation from Employment, policy #127 Exit Interviews, and policy #126 Breaks in Service and Rehire.</p><hr><h3>Secondary Employment</h3><p><strong>Secondary Employment outside the University</strong><br>Secondary employment outside of St. John’s University is not strictly prohibited. However, be aware that the University expects your full and complete commitment to employment here at St. John’s and it considers your full-time University position to be your primary employment. If your secondary employment raises an actual or potential conflict of interest or interferes with successful performance of your University job, the University may require that you either resign the secondary job or face termination by the University. You must have your supervisor’s approval if you wish to obtain secondary employment at another educational institution.

Your timesheet must show the exact number of hours you worked (excluding lunch) and any time off or leave you have taken (e.g., vacation, sick, personal, jury duty, etc.). You will complete and submit your timesheet to your supervisor for approval. Some departments file timesheets electronically on behalf of the employee, so check with your supervisor for specific department procedures.</p><p>Time should be rounded up to the nearest quarter hour (15 minutes). Time taken as paid/unpaid leave and time off must be clearly indicated on the timesheet. The appropriate hours should be entered under the correct earning code. If using unpaid time, enter 0 under earn code on the timesheet. In the unusual event that you work through an otherwise unpaid meal period, that time must be recorded as time worked. The online timesheet will calculate all hours, please review and click submit. Your supervisor will then need to review and approve your timesheet. Normally, timesheets must be submitted to Payroll on or before the end of the pay period.</p><p>Part-time administrator default hours for the semi-monthly pay period will be 40 hours. Non-exempt and student workers will be paid bi-weekly based on hours submitted.</p><p>Be aware that falsification of your timesheet is considered grounds for immediate termination. Also, you are not allowed to complete, make entries on, or sign a timesheet on behalf of someone else.

Hours over 35 but less than 40 in a workweek are not paid as overtime; they are considered straight-time hours. Your supervisor must approve, in advance, any extra hours you work.</p><p>Overtime is paid based on <strong>actual time worked</strong>. Holidays, vacation, sick time, personal time, jury duty and similar days in which you perform no work, are not counted toward the calculation of overtime. In addition, expenses such as travel or business expenses and special compensation such as discretionary bonuses or gifts are not used to calculate your “regular rate of pay.”</p><p>If you work between 35 and 40 hours in one week you can, with your supervisor’s approval, receive either straight time pay or compensatory time off for those hours. You must take compensatory time-off within the pay period in which you earn it. You may not carry-over compensatory time hours from one pay period to the next. If you work over 40 hours in a workweek, you cannot elect compensatory time-off in lieu of pay.</p><p>If you work more than 11 consecutive hours, you will be paid a $10 supper allowance.</p><p>For more on overtime, link to the full policy #310, or contact the Payroll Office on the Queens campus at extension 5953 or 6374.

Specific vacation information is listed separately below, first for administrators and then for staff. If you are on a Reduced Schedule your vacation time is prorated based on your schedule. If you are a part-time employee, you are not eligible for paid vacation time. Vacation requests require supervisor approval.</p><p>As a new hire, you accrue vacation but are not allowed to use it until the end of your three-month Orientation Period. Vacation time does not accrue during any period of unpaid leave. Upon separation from employment, you will be paid for the cash value of any unused accrued vacation time. You will not be paid for any vacation time that has not accrued as of the date of termination, and to which you are not otherwise entitled. Failure to report to work or to return from a leave or time-off may be interpreted by the University as a resignation.</p><p>Vacation request forms can be found on the <a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/my-st-johns/human-resources/forms">HR Forms</a> web page.</p><h4>Vacation for Administrators</h4><p>If you are a regular full-time administrator, you earn 22 days of vacation annually. You accrue this vacation at the rate of 1.83 days per month, starting January 1 of each year. In your first year of employment, your vacation is prorated. Ordinarily, you may not carry over unused vacation from one year to the next. Exceptions can only be made with the written approval of your department’s vice president. Vacation time does not accrue during absences from work of one month or longer.</p><p><strong>Vacation Calculations</strong><br>To calculate accrued vacation time during the year, full-time administrators should multiply the monthly accrual rate (1.83) by the number of months worked. Use the 50% rule to round up or down to the nearest half day. If an administrator works during any part of a month, he/she accrues vacation for the entire month.</p><p><em>Example:</em> If an administrator worked three months, he/she would have accrued 1.83 x 3 = 5.49, or rounded up to 5 ½ days of vacation. An administrator who worked two months would have 1.83 x 2 = 3.66, or rounded down to 3 ½ days.</p><p>Similarly, to calculate the amount of vacation payable to an administrator upon separation from employment, multiply the number of months worked in the calendar year by 1.83 to get the number of days accrued and then subtract any vacation time the administrator already used that year.</p><h4>Vacation for Staff</h4><p>If you are a regular full-time staff employee, your normal vacation period is the calendar year (January 1 to December 31). You should try to submit vacation requests to your supervisor by January 1 of the calendar year in which you want to take the vacation. Any changes to requests should be submitted to your supervisor at least two weeks prior to the time requested. All vacations are subject to your supervisor’s approval. If a staff employee works during any part of a month, he/she accrues vacation for the entire month.</p><p><strong>First Five Years of Service</strong><br>You accrue a maximum of ten (10) vacation days per year, prorated for each month worked. Remember, if you are a new employee, you accrue vacation but are not allowed to use it until you have completed your three-month Orientation Period.</p><p><strong>After Five Years of Service</strong><br>Beginning with the month in which your fifth anniversary of continuous full-time employment occurs, you begin to accrue vacation time at a rate of fifteen (15) days per year.</p><p><strong>After 10 Years of Service</strong><br>Beginning with the month in which your tenth anniversary of continuous full-time employment occurs, you begin to accrue vacation time at a rate of twenty (20) days per year. You can accrue no more than twenty (20) vacation days.</p><p><strong>Selection Criteria</strong><br>If there is a problem regarding the selection of vacation time in your office or department, selection will be made on the basis of years of continuous full-time service. The employee with the greatest length of continuous service will be allowed to select two weeks of vacation. Selection will then pass to the employee with the second most continuous service, and so on, until every employee has selected two weeks. Under no circumstances will an employee be allowed to choose more than two weeks until all employees in the department have had an opportunity to make a vacation selection.</p><p>Your supervisor is responsible for monitoring the vacation and sick time you use and your accrued balances.</p><p><strong>Staff Annual Vacation Schedule</strong></p><table style="width:100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2"

Check with your supervisor or with Human Resources Services if you have any questions about personal time. For illustrative purposes, "special situations of a personal nature" could include a home repair, a transportation issue, or a personal appointment.</p><p><strong>Personal Time for Administrators</strong><br>If you are a regular full-time administrator, you accrue 22 vacation days each calendar year, up to two (2) of which may be used as personal days. In addition, if a special situation of a personal nature arises during the course of a workday,&nbsp;you may request personal time off during the day. This personal time is not to be interpreted as a day or days off, but instead may mean your arrival at work is delayed or you leave work early to handle the situation. The University expects that you will complete your work so that there is no negative impact on the department as a result of the absence. Personal time is an exception and any pattern of absence may be cause for disciplinary action. Your supervisor is responsible for maintaining a record of your absences and must approve any request for personal time.</p><p><strong>Personal Time for Staff</strong><br>If you are a regular full-time staff employee, you may use a maximum of two (2) of the 10 days of sick time coverage per year for special situations of a personal nature. All requests for personal days must be approved <em>in advance</em> by your supervisor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Temporary Work Schedule Changes for Covered Personal Events</strong><br>After 120 days of employment and at least 80 hours worked in the calendar year, you may request two (2) temporary work schedule changes to attend to certain covered personal events. A temporary work schedule change includes a limited alteration in your work hours, a temporary alteration to your ordinary work location, using paid time off, working remotely, swapping or shifting work hours, and using short-term unpaid leave.

Public Safety Officers — who provide essential support to the University and work outside of normal office hours — and employees at the Bartilucci Center are ineligible for early dismissal and special holidays. This exemption may also apply to other positions whose work weeks are outside of normal office hours and/or when necessitated by the nature of the work performed.</p><p>To qualify for holiday pay, full-time administrators and staff must be on active pay status on the work day immediately preceding and following the holiday. No pay is given for holidays that fall during an employee's unpaid leave or after an employee's final work day when employment has ended.

Administrators are only permitted to apply sick time when the leave is due to the employee’s own health condition (see Sick Time policy). During any unpaid portion of FMLA leave, paid leave (including vacation, sick time and holiday) does not accrue.

You will be notified of any premium payment schedule at the time you begin your leave.</li><li>During an approved leave, you will continue to receive credit for service time at the University.</li><li>When you have exhausted the 12 weeks of leave under the FMLA, the University may recruit to fill your position or eliminate or restructure the position, based on the needs of the department or the University. At the end of the FMLA-covered period, if you do not return to work, or you do not request or are not granted an extension of the leave under the Americans with Disabilities Act or a Personal Leave of Absence, or when you exhaust all accrued sick time and the general leave of absence period expires, you will be terminated from employment with the University.</li></ol><p>For the full text of Family and Medical leave, refer to policy #502 in the <a href="/node/21996">Human Resources Policy Manual</a><em>.</em></p><hr><h3>Personal Leave of Absence</h3><p>If you are a regular full-time or part-time administrator or staff, you can apply for a leave of absence (LOA) without pay for personal reasons, not to exceed six (6) months.

Coverage includes travel on commercial airlines, railroads, buses, and private passenger automobiles. Your normal commute between home and St. John’s does not fall into this category of business travel and is not covered by the policy.

This is a legal services plan that provides legal representation for employees, spouse and dependents for important, everyday legal services and/or unexpected legal matters.

The benefit of paying for qualifying expenses with pre-tax dollars is that it reduces your taxable income. Qualified Mass Transit Expenses include expenses incurred for traveling in a commuter highway vehicle (i.e., van pool) and on mass transit vehicles (i.e., bus, train, subway or ferry) between your home and work. You can stop and resume deductions under the QTE Plan at any time, and the excess balance in a QTE account carries over from month to month.</p><p>To enroll, contact the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="46b6b40f-25b9-47ec-bcca-fdc81ca8221e" href="/who-we-are/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-senior-vice-president-and-chief-operating-officer/human-resources/employee-benefits" title="Employee Benefits">Employee Benefits</a> office at 718-990-2363 or extension 2363 on campus.<a name="social-security"></a></p><hr><h3>Social Security</h3><p>St. John’s makes contributions to Social Security that equal the contributions you make through payment of Social Security (F.I.C.A.) taxes.

Your conduct is expected to be consistent with the University's Core Values and compatible with the goals and purposes of an educational institution established in the Vincentian tradition.</p><p>As a representative of St. John's, the University expects you to exhibit professionalism on the job and in your contact with others. Professional conduct can range from the manner in which you answer the telephone or address a visitor to the integrity and honesty with which you perform your work. University policies that relate to your professional conduct can be found throughout this handbook.</p><p>If your conduct violates University policy, you may be subject to corrective action. (For more on corrective action, see "When Corrective Action Is Needed" later in this section, or policy #702 in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>.)</p><p><strong>Use of University Property and Resources</strong><br>
You are allowed to use St. John's property and resources (i.e.: facilities, equipment, supplies, technology, the University's name, stationery, etc.) only in the course of conducting University business. Use of the St. John's name, stationery, or postage for personal purposes, including activities such as private business ventures, endorsement of political candidates, and organization of social or charitable events, may violate both criminal and civil laws and could result in legal action.</p><p>You are not allowed to duplicate any University keys that you have and you must return keys to the University, along with any other University property that you possess, when you terminate employment.</p><p>If you experience a problem with any University equipment, you should immediately report the problem to a supervisor. Information Technology policies such as Computer and Information Security are addressed below and can be found in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>, Section 900.</p><p><strong>Telephone Use</strong><br>
Office telephones are an important means of conducting University business. Personal calls can interfere with important business calls and should be made only in an emergency. Urgent personal calls should be kept as brief as possible.</p><p>Telephone manner is a vital part of the University's public relations. The impression that you make on a caller is often the only impression the caller will have of both you and the University. The quality and tone of voice you use project the attitude with which you approach your job. If you have any questions about the specific manner in which to answer calls, please check with your supervisor.</p><p>You should practice the following courtesies:</p><ul><li>Answer phones promptly</li><li>Identify yourself</li><li>Quickly notify the person being called, if other than you</li><li>Be attentive and obtain complete and accurate information</li><li>Explain any delays, transfer calls competently, and end calls pleasantly</li></ul><p>You should make every effort to assist callers in the most efficient and polite manner possible. It is also expected that you display professionalism and courtesy when you make calls and leave messages in voicemail.</p><p><strong>Attendance</strong><br>
Every St. John's employee is a vital part of the operation of the University and any absence necessitates a temporary adjustment of work schedules. You are required to notify your supervisor directly, and on a daily basis, if you will be late or are unable to work. If you cannot call your supervisor, someone else must notify your supervisor on your behalf. In the event of such an unscheduled absence or lateness, you should contact your supervisor as early as possible, but not later than 30 minutes after your scheduled start time. Some departments, such as those that provide services outside of normal office hours, may require earlier notification from their employees. Employees should become familiar with the attendance procedures for their department.</p><p>Frequent absences and lateness impair the value of your service and could result in discharge. Failure to contact your supervisor regarding your inability to report to work will be considered an unexcused absence, which may warrant corrective action.</p><p><strong>Professional Attire</strong><br>
As an employee, you represent the University. In order to maintain a positive and professional image and in consideration of others, all employees should dress in appropriate professional attire. If you have a question about what constitutes professional attire, you should seek the advice of your supervisor.</p><p>Additional information can be found in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>, policy #801 Professional Conduct.<a name="confidentiality"></a></p><hr><h3>Confidentiality</h3><p>For reasons of privacy and ethics, you are responsible to observe a high level of confidentiality in all matters relating to the University, its employees and students. Whenever you have a doubt about whether confidentiality is necessary in a particular situation, it is always better to maintain confidentiality. Breaches of confidentiality can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p><p>See policy #706 Confidentiality. For guidelines relating to the <strong>confidentiality of student education records</strong> under the "Buckley Amendment," refer to "Student Files: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act" in the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a7fcf3a-4b98-4e29-9c15-f8a9eb96074a" href="/who-we-are/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/division-student-success/student-handbook">Student Handbook</a></em> available online, or contact the Office of Student Life on your campus.

Employees must refrain from any act and avoid any situation that may create an actual or apparent conflict between self-interest and the University's interest. Each employee should be free from any conflicting interest or influence that would make it difficult to render to the University his or her best efforts and undivided loyalty and attention. Employees are required to disclose to the University in writing any actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest as soon as they become aware of the possibility of a conflict of interest.</p><p>Transactions with outside firms must be conducted in a professional manner. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when employees or their family members have a material financial interest or personal interest in the transaction or in an entity that proposes to do business or does business with the University. Employees must also avoid situations that may create an actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest between an employee and a member of the Board of Trustees. This includes business relationships, loans, gifts or other financial transactions involving a Trustee and an employee or a member of the employee’s family. Any approval or resolution of a conflict situation must be in writing with a copy provided to the Office of General Counsel.</p><p>The full text of the University's Conflict of Interest policy provides guidance on expectations for employee conduct in these sensitive matters. Because no statement can address every situation, if you have questions concerning your obligation to the University, or whether a circumstance may create an actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest, you should seek the advice of your supervisor, or contact the University's General Counsel for specific guidance.</p><p>Employees are prohibited from giving or receiving any gift that creates an actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest regardless of materiality. Generally, employees and their family members are prohibited from accepting gifts or entertainment from persons or organizations doing business or seeking to do business with the University. When it is difficult or contrary to good public relations to refuse certain gifts or entertainment, they must be accepted only if they meet the standards described in section 3 of the policy. This section addresses the following circumstances: Vendor gifts/entertainment; Employee gifts; Gifts among employees; and Gifts to Non-employees.</p><p><strong>Gifts</strong><br>
Gifts to employees paid for by the University are generally not permitted. University departments, however, are permitted to provide a gift on behalf of the University for sympathy expressions for illness or death of an employee or an employee's immediate family member. Memorial gifts made on behalf of the University may include flowers or a donation to a charitable organization. A recommended limit for this type of gift is $100.00. All such gifts must be approved by a Vice President or Dean level administrator. Gifts for life events such as weddings, engagements, birth of child, holidays, and birthday may not be paid for with University funds.</p><p>Cash, checks, gift cards, and gift certificates are prohibited as gifts to employees. Employees should consult with the Human Resources department if there is a situation where a department wishes to provide a nominal gift certificate or gift card as part of a program or in connection with an event. Gifts in recognition of employee work-related achievement or years of service are only allowable as provided through official recognition programs authorized by the Human Resources department. Employees are permitted to use personal funds to provide a gift to a fellow employee for life events; however, if a gift exceeds $250.00 the employee must disclose it to his/her supervisor in writing with a copy to the Office of General Counsel.</p><p>Additional information can be found in the complete Conflict of Interest policy located in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>.<a id="info-tech" name="info-tech"></a></p><hr><h3>Information Technology</h3><p>The St. John’s University department of Information Technology publishes and manages numerous information security policies with which you are responsible to comply.

The effects of your performance and behavior at work can have positive or negative impact on the people you work with, your workplace, and on the reputation of St. John's. Corrective action is the term used by the University to refer to its flexible approach to addressing and resolving employee performance and behavior problems.</p><p><strong>The University believes that disciplinary measures should be corrective and progressive in nature; however, serious misconduct, work performance problems, or violations of laws and/or university policies and procedures may warrant immediate and severe discipline, including termination of employment.</strong></p><p>During the three-month Orientation Period, progressive discipline does not apply. Supervisors evaluate newly hired employees at the end of three months to determine whether or not employment will be continued. For more on the Orientation Period, you can refer to <strong>New Hire Information</strong> in the ABOUT YOUR EMPLOYMENT section in this handbook. Successful completion of the Orientation Period does not guarantee your continued employment for any particular length of time (see <strong>Employment at Will</strong>).</p><p>If you have an issue relating to a verbal or written warning or performance plan, you should discuss the problem with your supervisor. If the issue is not resolved, you should seek guidance from HR Services. Should you continue to feel that corrective action has been unduly applied, you may pursue resolution through the University's Complaint Resolution mechanism (see <strong>When You Have a Complaint</strong>).</p><p><strong>Corrective Action Measures</strong><br>
Ongoing performance feedback, counseling and training should be part of your supervisor's daily approach to managing employees. Using informal remedial actions such as these help supervisors to identify performance and/or behavior issues when they begin. Trained Human Resources professionals provide supervisors with guidance and assistance in counseling and corrective action, as well as offer workshops on the subject.</p><p>There are times when more formal measures of corrective action become necessary. In such cases, the University has guidelines for corrective action measures that include verbal warnings, written warnings, shift changes and suspension. Continuing or severe performance problems or serious misconduct may result in termination of employment. Reasons for discharging an employee may include, but are not limited to, misconduct, unsatisfactory work performance, absenteeism, insubordination, violations of University policy or rules, dishonesty, illegal acts, conflict of interest, or any act deemed inconsistent with the University's Mission.</p><p>Although they are intended to be progressive in nature, the appropriate measures for addressing problems always depend on the behavior or performance problem in question. Oral and written warnings may be repeated as appropriate under the circumstances. Regardless of which form of corrective action is being used, the following should be clearly communicated and understood by both the employee and the supervisor:</p><ul><li>That a behavior or performance problem exists, and what the specific nature of the problem is</li><li>Necessary steps to correct the problem and clear expectations for satisfactory improvement</li><li>The consequences of non-compliance with the steps or improvement plan indicated</li></ul><p>Suspension, with or without pay, may be used when the actions of an employee are being investigated. The employee is placed on suspension while the investigation is conducted. The outcome of the investigation determines whether the employee is reinstated (either with or without further disciplinary action) or is discharged. Suspension may also be an option for disciplinary action when an employee has committed a serious infraction.</p><p>The University retains the right to terminate your employment at will, with or without cause or reason and with or without notice.

Printed crime prevention brochures, crime prevention tips, posters, bookmarks, and special safety-oriented campus maps are distributed at crime prevention presentations, Orientation sessions, and at various locations on the University campuses.</p><p><strong>Campus Security Act Annual Report</strong><br>
Annually, the University’s Public Safety Department updates security information and makes it available to the University community on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3495b519-4654-4e16-a3b4-7a314e7f905a" href="/who-we-are/public-safety" title="Public Safety">Public Safety</a> website.

St. John’s University provides programs for students, parents, faculty, staff and residence life addressing safety issues and crime prevention on campus. These programs are provided at Orientations, in trainings, and on the Web. All faculty and staff are required to attend an Emergency Response training program conducted by the Department of Public Safety. Emergency phones, a surveillance system and escort service operate 24 hours a day. Routine fire drills are conducted in each campus building once a semester. In addition, all buildings have a public address system to be used in the case of emergencies. An email and phone alert system notifies the University community of emergency situations. Public Safety officers engage in routine motorized and foot patrol on the Queens and Staten Island campuses on a 24 hour basis.</p><p><strong>Timely Warnings</strong><br>
In the event that a situation arises, either on or off campus, that, in the judgment of the Executive Director of Public Safety constitutes an ongoing or continuing threat, a campus wide Public Safety Advisory will be issued. The warning will be issued through the University's e-mail system to students, faculty, and staff, and it will be posted on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3495b519-4654-4e16-a3b4-7a314e7f905a" href="/who-we-are/public-safety" title="Public Safety">Public Safety website</a>.</p><p>Depending on the particular circumstances of the crime, especially in situations that could pose an immediate threat to the community and individuals, Public Safety may also issue an emergency text and voice message alert through the University Emergency Notification System and or utilize the public address system on campus to alert our community.</p><p>Additional information can be found in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>, policy #1006.<a name="report-student-crisis"></a></p><hr><h3>Reporting Student Crisis Situations</h3><p>Every member of the faculty, administration and staff of St. John’s University, acting in his or her capacity as an employee of the University, is obligated to immediately report any incident of sexual assault, rape or other forcible sexual offense against any student member of the University community upon learning of the incident. Moreover, every member of the faculty, administration and staff is similarly obligated to report any incident of intimate partner violence or stalking against any student member of the University community upon learning of the incident. Then continue with the next sentence, which ends the paragraph. Even when a student requests confidentiality of the incident, the employee has a responsibility to report it according to the reporting structure described below.</p><p>It is further the responsibility of every member of the faculty, administration and staff of the University to immediately report other student crisis situations that he or she may learn of to University officials. Examples of such student crisis situations would include, but are not limited to, a suicide attempt or thoughts of suicide, immediate or serious threat to a student’s safety or the safety of others, self-starvation of a life-threatening nature, and other health-related emergencies or involuntary confinement to a hospital or health facility. The reporting structure is described below.</p><p><strong>Reporting Structure</strong><br>
When the student situation is a crisis, but no imminent danger exists, report it to:</p><ul><li><strong>Dean of Students</strong> (Queens ext. 6774; Staten Island ext. 4445; Manhattan ext. 5173); or</li><li><strong>Vice President for Public Safety</strong> at 718-990-5252 or Queens ext. 5252; Staten Island ext 4487, Manhattan ext. 5155.</li></ul><p>When a student is in imminent danger, <strong>call 911 and Public Safety</strong> directly from any campus phone, before following the reporting structure provided.

The University has instituted a Text and Voice Messaging System to alert members of the University community in cases of emergencies affecting one or more of our campuses. Individuals must either register or opt out to the free service via the University Information System’s (<a href="https://apollo.stjohns.edu/sjusis/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=bmenu.P_MainMnu">UIS</a>) secure site. Log on to <a href="https://apollo.stjohns.edu/sjusis/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=bmenu.P_MainMnu">UIS</a>, go to the Personal Information Menu and follow the prompts. Once registered, you will receive text and voice messages to your cell phone or off-campus wired telephone if and when emergencies occur on any of our U.S. campuses. These communications will alert you to the situation and direct you as to what action to take to secure your safety.</p><p>While there are other information sources available for messages on the status of events unfolding (St. John’s Web site at www.stjohns.edu, University emergency bulletins on (718) 990-2000, voice broadcast and e-mail messages), the text messaging system is the most effective immediate alert system available to members of the University community.</p><p>Messages that are conveyed through these communication systems will be specific to the particular situation. However, there are two common forms of safety instruction: “Stay in Place” or “Evacuate.”</p><ul><li><strong>In the event of a Stay-in-Place order:</strong> Stay calm….do not panic; Safely stop work; If safe, close office windows, but do not lock them unless there is a direct threat; Move to the safest place within your work area; When necessary, stay away from glass doors and windows; Do not leave the building or work area until instructed to do so by the proper authorities; Do not remain in the hallway or stairwells, but proceed to a safe room within the building.</li><li><strong>In the event of an Evacuation order</strong>: Stay calm… do not rush or panic; Safely stop work; Gather personal belongings if it is safe to do so; If safe, close office doors and windows while evacuating, but do not lock them; Use the closest safe stairs and proceed to the nearest exit, do not use the elevator; Follow the instructions of Public Safety Officers and Emergency Evacuation Volunteers (EEVs) who will direct you to an assembly area; Wait for instructions from Public Safety or emergency responders; Do not re-enter the building or work area until instructed to do so by the proper authorities.</li></ul><p>St. John’s is extremely fortunate to have such a high caliber of personnel in the field of Emergency Preparedness working in Public Safety, and the incredible resources of the NYPD, but it is also critical that each of us take responsibility for ensuring that we are aware of what to do in an emergency situation. <strong>Remember, you must register in order to receive emergency text and voice messages.</strong> To do so, log onto the UIS system directly, go to the Personal Information Menu and simply follow the prompts.</p><p>For more information about safety at St. John's, visit the web at www.stjohns.edu/safety.

Please do not call the Office of Public Safety on any of the St. John’s campuses, as these calls tie up the lines for safety emergencies.</li><li>The St. John’s website (www.stjohns.edu) will carry a written notice with the same updated information as provided by phone.</li><li>Area television and radio stations will include St. John’s in their listing of school closings and delayed openings. These include WINS 1010 AM and WCBS 880 AM, which make recurring announcements throughout the day, usually beginning around 5 a.m.</li><li>Text and voice messaging may be employed in case of an emergency on or around one or more St. John’s campuses.</li><li>Should the decision to close the University occur during the work/school day, other means of communication may also be used. These include the Audix phone system, email and the campus digital signage.</li></ul><p>If the emergency event occurs during business hours, senior management will make a decision on the best time to close based on the emergency conditions, class schedules, exams and other scheduled University functions, which will be communicated via the channels as outlined above.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong><br>
Employees who were scheduled to work receive their regular compensation for time lost due to an emergency school closing or a delayed opening/early dismissal. Part-time and temporary employees are also compensated if they were scheduled to work on the day of the closing. Employees who had scheduled time off from work on the day of the school closing would not be affected by the closing and, therefore, their time would remain charged as paid time off or leave, as appropriate. (Compensation for student workers is addressed in policy #1028.)</p><p>When an early dismissal is announced, employees who can leave early may do so. No compensatory time is granted to those who remain at work. Similarly, no compensatory time is granted in the case of a delayed opening when an employee reports to work earlier than the delayed opening time.</p><p><strong>Essential Personnel</strong><br>
When University offices are closed or a delayed opening or early dismissal is announced due to an emergency such as severe weather, certain essential employees are requested to report as usual. These include, but may not be limited to, Public Safety Officers, animal facility caretakers, administrative employees in Facilities Services and other positions as determined by department supervisors.</p><p>Additional information can be found in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39b6da53-206d-43e5-9376-c2d5647dc174" href="/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/human-resources/human-resources-policy-manual" title="Human Resources Policy Manual">Human Resources Policy Manual</a>, policy #1028.<a name="pregnant-workers"></a></p><hr><h3>Pregnant Workers Fairness</h3><p>St. John’s University complies with New York City Human Rights law that prohibits discrimination in employment based on pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition.
